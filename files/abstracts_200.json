In the \netiology of Hirschsprung disease various genes play a role; these are: RET, \nEDNRB, GDNF, EDN3 and SOX10, NTN3, ECE1, Mutations in these genes may result in \ndominant, recessive or multifactorial patterns of inheritance. Diverse models of \ninheritance, co-existence of numerous genetic disorders and detection of \nnumerous chromosomal aberrations together with involvement of various genes \nconfirm the genetic heterogeneity of Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease \nmight well serve as a model for many complex disorders in which the search for \nresponsible genes has only just been initiated. It seems that the most important \nrole in its genetic etiology plays the RET gene, which is involved in the \netiology of at least four diseases. This review focuses on recent advances of \nthe importance of RET gene in the etiology of Hirschsprung disease.\n\nPMID: 15858239 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

In a study of 690 European- and 192 Chinese-descent probands and \ntheir parents or controls, we demonstrate the ubiquity of a >4-fold \nsusceptibility from a C-->T allele (rs2435357: p = 3.9 x 10(-43) in European \nancestry; p = 1.1 x 10(-21) in Chinese samples) that probably arose once within \nthe intronic RET enhancer MCS+9.7. With in vitro assays, we now show that the T \nvariant disrupts a SOX10 binding site within MCS+9.7 that compromises RET \ntransactivation. The T allele, with a control frequency of 20%-30%\/47% and case \nfrequency of 54%-62%\/88% in European\/Chinese-ancestry individuals, is involved \nin all forms of HSCR. It is marginally associated with proband gender (p = 0.13) \nand significantly so with length of aganglionosis (p = 7.6 x 10(-5)) and \nfamiliality (p = 6.2 x 10(-4)). The enhancer variant is more frequent in the \ncommon forms of male, short-segment, and simplex families whereas multiple, \nrare, coding mutations are the norm in the less common and more severe forms of \nfemale, long-segment, and multiplex families. The T variant also increases \npenetrance in patients with rare RET coding mutations. Thus, both rare and \ncommon mutations, individually and together, make contributions to the risk of \nHSCR. The distribution of RET variants in diverse HSCR patients suggests a \n\"cellular-recessive\" genetic model where both RET alleles' function is \ncompromised. The RET allelic series, and its genotype-phenotype correlations, \nshows that success in variant identification in complex disorders may strongly \ndepend on which patients are studied.\n\nCopyright 2010 The American Society of Human Genetics.

We identify a new mode of EGFR ligand signaling via exosomes. Human \nbreast and colorectal cancer cells release exosomes containing full-length, \nsignaling-competent EGFR ligands. Exosomes isolated from MDCK cells expressing \nindividual full-length EGFR ligands displayed differential activities; AREG \nexosomes increased invasiveness of recipient breast cancer cells 4-fold over \nTGF\u03b1 or HB-EGF exosomes and 5-fold over equivalent amounts of recombinant AREG. \nExosomal AREG displayed significantly greater membrane stability than TGF\u03b1 or \nHB-EGF. An average of 24\u00a0AREG molecules are packaged within an individual \nexosome, and AREG exosomes are rapidly internalized by recipient cells. Whether \nthe composition and behavior of exosomes differ between nontransformed and \ntransformed cells is unknown. Exosomes from DLD-1\u00a0colon cancer cells with a \nmutant KRAS allele exhibited both higher AREG levels and greater invasive \npotential than exosomes from isogenically matched, nontransformed cells in which \nmutant KRAS was eliminated by homologous recombination.

The protomer is a \n225 +\/- 15-nm thread which is disulfide-linked into a loop with fine, protruding \nthread ends. Oligomers form clover-leaf-like structures.

Our \nanalyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of \nprotein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing \nsignals, and exon\/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, \nlncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are \npredominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to \nbe preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective \npressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter \nregions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. \nImportantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. \nComprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain \nregions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding \ngenes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large \nfraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression \ncorrelation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive \ncorrelation with the expression of antisense coding genes.

We introduce the coSI measure, based on RNA-seq reads mapping to \nexon junctions and borders, to assess the degree of splicing completion around \ninternal exons. We show that, as expected, splicing is almost fully completed in \ncytosolic polyA+ RNA. In chromatin-associated RNA (which includes the RNA that \nis being transcribed), for 5.6% of exons, the removal of the surrounding introns \nis fully completed, compared with 0.3% of exons for which no intron-removal has \noccurred. The remaining exons exist as a mixture of spliced and fewer unspliced \nmolecules, with a median coSI of 0.75. Thus, most RNAs undergo splicing while \nbeing transcribed: \"co-transcriptional splicing.\" Consistent with \nco-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant \nenrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with \nother cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs. CoSI scores \ndecrease along the gene, pointing to a \"first transcribed, first spliced\" rule, \nyet more downstream exons carry other characteristics, favoring rapid, \nco-transcriptional intron removal. Exons with low coSI values, that is, in the \nprocess of being spliced, are enriched with chromatin marks, consistent with a \nrole for chromatin in splicing during transcription.

Of relevance to the production \nof RANKL in pathologic bone loss, expression of this secreted TNFSF11 transcript \nis upregulated in Jurkat T cells and primary human T cells upon activation. \nFurthermore, this transcript can be translated and secreted in Jurkat T cells in \nvitro and is able to support osteoclast differentiation.

There were no significant differences in peak serum TT4 concentrations \n(p\u2009=\u20090.13) and time to peak TT4 concentrations (p\u2009=\u20090.19) before and after one \nweek of metformin use. A trend toward reduced TT4 AUC was observed after \nmetformin ingestion (pre-metformin 3893\u2009\u00b1\u2009568\u2009\u03bcg\/dL-min, post-metformin \n3765\u2009\u00b1\u2009588\u2009\u03bcg\/dL-min, p\u2009=\u20090.09).\nCONCLUSIONS: LT4 absorption is unchanged by concomitant metformin ingestion. \nMechanisms other than increased LT4 absorption may be responsible for the \nsuppressed TSH concentrations observed in patients ingesting both drugs.\n\nDOI: 10.1089\/thy.2015.0211\nPMCID: PMC4589100\nPMID: 26191653 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

However, 20% of patients with stage I EOC \nrelapse within 5 years. It is therefore crucial that the biological properties \nof stage I EOCs are further elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have shown diagnostic \nand prognostic potential in stage III and IV EOCs, but the small number of \npatients diagnosed with stage I EOC has so far prevented an investigation of its \nmolecular features. We profiled miRNA expression in stage I EOC tumours to \nassess whether there is a miRNA signature associated with overall and \nprogression-free survival (PFS) in stage I EOC.\nMETHODS: We analysed tumour samples from 144 patients (29 of whom relapsed) with \nstage I EOC gathered from two independent tumour tissue collections (A and B), \nboth with a median follow-up of 9 years. 89 samples from tumour tissue \ncollection A were stratified into a training set (51 samples, 15 of which were \nfrom patients who relapsed) for miRNA signature generation, and into a \nvalidation set (38 samples, seven of which were from patients who relapsed) for \nsignature validation. Tumour tissue collection B (55 samples, seven of which \nwere from patients who relapsed) was used as an independent test set. The Cox \nproportional hazards model and the log-rank test were used to assess the \ncorrelation of quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)-validated miRNAs \nwith overall survival and PFS.\nFINDINGS: A signature of 34 miRNAs associated with survival was generated by \nmicroarray analysis in the training set. In both the training set and validation \nset, qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that 11 miRNAs (miR-214, miR-199a-3p, \nmiR-199a-5p, miR-145, miR-200b, miR-30a, miR-30a*, miR-30d, miR-200c, miR-20a, \nand miR-143) were expressed differently in relapsers compared with \nnon-relapsers. Three of these miRNAs (miR-200c, miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-5p) were \nassociated with PFS, overall survival, or both in multivariate analysis. qRT-PCR \nanalysis in the test set confirmed the downregulation of miR-200c in relapsers \ncompared with non-relapsers, but not the upregulation of miR-199a-3p and \nmiR-199a-5p. Multivariate analysis confirmed that downregulation of miR-200c in \nthe test set was associated with overall survival (HR 0\u00b7094, 95% CI 0\u00b7012-0\u00b7766, \np=0\u00b70272) and PFS (0\u00b7035, 0\u00b7004-0\u00b7311; p=0\u00b70026), independent of clinical \ncovariates.\nINTERPRETATION: miR-200c has potential as a predictor of survival, and is a \nbiomarker of relapse, in stage I EOC.\nFUNDING: Nerina and Mario Mattioli Foundation, Cariplo Foundation (Grant Number \n2010-0744), and the Italian Association for Cancer Research.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, \nmiR-100 was reported to be downregulated in human ovarian carcinoma, however, \nthe clinical significance and functional roles of miR-100 expression in human \nEOC are unclear. TaqMan real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay was performed to \ndetect the expression of miR-100 in 98 EOC tissues and 15 adjacent normal \nepithelial tissues. The relationship between miR-100 expression and \nclinicopathological factors in 98 EOC patients was statistically analyzed. The \neffect of miR-100 expression on patient survival was determined. Finally, the \nrole of miR-100 in EOC cell growth and its possible mechanisms were analyzed \nwith miR-100 precursor or inhibitor-transfected cells. We showed that the level \nof miR-100 was significantly lower in EOC tissues compared to adjacent normal \ntissues. Low miR-100 expression was found to be closely correlated with advanced \nFIGO stage, higher serum CA125 expression level and lymph node involvement. \nAlso, low miR-100 expression was correlated with shorter overall survival of EOC \npatients, and multivariate analysis showed that the status of miR-100 expression \nwas an independent predictor of overall survival in EOC. Additionally, miR-100 \ncould affect the growth of EOC cells by post-transcriptionally regulating \npolo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) expression. Together, these results suggest that low \nmiR-100 expression may be an independent poor prognostic factor and miR-100 can \nfunction as a tumor suppressor by targeting PLK1 in human EOCs.\n\nDOI: 10.3892\/or.2012.1625\nPMCID: PMC3583406\nPMID: 22246341 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Current guidelines and recommendations for MG \ntreatment are based largely on clinical experience, retrospective analyses and \nexpert consensus. Available therapies include oral acetylcholinesterase (AChE) \ninhibitors for symptomatic treatment, and short- and long-term disease-modifying \ntreatments. This review focuses on treatment of MG, mainly on the use of the \nAChE inhibitor pyridostigmine. Despite a lack of data from well controlled \nclinical trials to support their use, AChE inhibitors, of which pyridostigmine \nis the most commonly used, are recommended as first-line therapy for MG. \nPyridostigmine has been used as a treatment for MG for over 50 years and is \ngenerally considered safe. It is suitable as a long-term treatment in patients \nwith generalized non-progressive milder disease, and as an adjunctive therapy in \npatients with severe disease who are also receiving immunotherapy. Novel AChE \ninhibitors with oral antisense oligonucleotides have been developed and \npreliminary results appear to be promising. In general, however, AChE inhibitors \nprovide only partial benefit and most patients eventually switch to long-term \nimmunosuppressive therapies, most frequently corticosteroids and\/or \nazathioprine. Although AChE inhibitors are known to be well tolerated and \neffective in relieving the symptoms of MG, further efforts are required to \nimprove treatment options for the management of this disorder.\n\nDOI: 10.2165\/11593300-000000000-00000\nPMID: 21815707 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

We demonstrate \nthat NOTCH3 forms heterodimers with NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4. R90C and C49Y \nmutant NOTCH3 form complexes which are more resistant to detergents than wild \ntype NOTCH3 complexes. Using quantitative NOTCH3-luciferase clearance assays, we \nfound significant inhibition of mutant NOTCH3 clearance.

This disease is diagnosed \nprimarily in children younger than 5 years and is disproportionately observed in \nformer premature infants. Cytogenetically, hepatoblastoma is characterized by \nnumerical aberrations, as well as unbalanced translocations involving the \nproximal region of chromosome 1q. The NOTCH2 gene has been mapped to this locus, \nand it is well established that the NOTCH gene family is an important regulator \nof several developmental pathways. Specifically, the NOTCH2 protein is known to \ndelay hepatoblast maturation during early hepatic organogenesis, and the \nreduction of NOTCH2 expression correlates with the differentiation of \nhepatoblasts into hepatocytes and biliary cells in the developing liver. We \nhypothesized that NOTCH2 is involved in the pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma by \nmaintaining a population of undifferentiated hepatoblasts. We studied the \nimmunohistochemical expression of NOTCH2 and its isoforms NOTCH1, NOTCH3, and \nNOTCH4 and the NOTCH2 primary ligand JAGGED1 in hepatoblastomas. Compared with \nthe normal liver, an increased level of NOTCH2 expression was seen in 22 of 24 \n(92%) hepatoblastomas. There was no significant staining for other NOTCH \nisoforms and JAGGED1 in hepatoblastomas. Therefore, we suggest that NOTCH2 \nexpression and activation, independent of JAGGED1 expression, may contribute to \nthe pathogenesis of hepatoblastoma. In the hepatoblastoma sinusoidal \nvasculature, we saw NOTCH3 and NOTCH1 expression. These observations have \npotential implications with regard to therapeutic targeting of the NOTCH \nsignaling pathway in hepatoblastomas.\n\nDOI: 10.2350\/10-09-0900-OA.1\nPMID: 21639801 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Whereas the mechanistic events \nassociated with senescence are generally well understood at the molecular level, \nthe impact of senescence in vivo remains to be fully determined. In addition to \nthe role of senescence as an antitumor mechanism, this review examines cellular \nsenescence as a factor in organismal aging and age-related diseases, with \nparticular emphasis on aberrant gene expression and abnormal paracrine \nsignaling. Senescence as an emerging factor in tissue remodeling, wound repair, \nand infection is considered. In addition, the role of oxidative stress as a \nmajor mediator of senescence and the role of NAD(P)H oxidases and changes to \nintracellular GSH\/GSSG status are reviewed. Recent findings indicate that \nsenescence and the behavior of senescent cells are amenable to therapeutic \nintervention.

Orteronel inhibits the 17,20 \nlyase activity of the enzyme CYP17A1, which is important for androgen synthesis \nin the testes, adrenal glands and prostate cancer cells. Preclinical studies \ndemonstrate that orteronel treatment suppresses androgen levels and causes \nshrinkage of androgen-dependent organs, such as the prostate gland. Early \nreports of clinical studies demonstrate that orteronel treatment leads to \nreduced prostate-specific antigen levels, a marker of prostate cancer tumor \nburden, and more complete suppression of androgen synthesis than conventional \nandrogen deprivation therapies that act in the testes alone. Treatment with \nsingle-agent orteronel has been well tolerated with fatigue as the most common \nadverse event, while febrile neutropenia was the dose-limiting toxicity in a \ncombination study of orteronel with docetaxel.

In this study, the effects of \nradioimmunotherapy against Her2 in prostate cancer were investigated.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: DU145, an androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cell \nline, was used in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the effects of Herceptin labeled \nwith a beta emitter, Rhenium-188 (Re-188). Its effects on cell growth, extent of \napoptosis, the bio-distribution of Re-188 labeled Herceptin (Re-H), and protein \nlevels were determined.\nRESULTS: Treatments with Re-188 and Re-H reduced the proliferation of DU145 \ncells in dose- and time-dependent manners compared to the Herceptin-treated \ngroup. Growth inhibition and apoptosis were induced after Re-H treatment; growth \ninhibition was more distinct in cells with high Her2\/p-Her2 levels. Our in vivo \nxenograft studies revealed that Re-H treatment significantly retarded tumor \ngrowth and altered the levels of apoptosis-related proteins. The \nbio-distribution of Re-H in mice demonstrated a tissue-specific pattern. \nImportantly, the levels of p35 protein, which is related to cancer cell survival \nand invasion, dramatically decreased after Re-H treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that Re-188-labeled Herceptin effectively \ninhibited the growth of DU145 cells compared to the Herceptin- and \nRe-188-treated cohorts.

Recent \nstudies demonstrated that ATP can be released from cells in a controlled manner \nthrough pannexin (Panx) channels. Panx1-mediated ATP release is involved in \ninflammasome activation and neutrophil\/macrophage chemotaxis, activation of T \ncells, and a role for Panx1 in inducing and propagating inflammation has been \ndemonstrated in various organs, including lung and the central and peripheral \nnervous system. The recognition and clearance of dying cells and debris from \nfocal points of inflammation is critical in the resolution of inflammation, and \nPanx1-mediated ATP release from dying cells has been shown to recruit \nphagocytes. Moreover, extracellular ATP can be broken down by ectonucleotidases \ninto ADP, AMP, and adenosine, which is critical in the resolution of \ninflammation. Together, Panx1, ATP, purinergic receptors, and ectonucleotidases \ncontribute to important feedback loops during the inflammatory response, and \nthus represent promising candidates for new therapies.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Thus, we investigated functional\/molecular changes in I(f), the \nspecific target of ivabradine, in the failing atrial and ventricular myocytes \nwhere this current is up-regulated as a consequence of maladaptive remodelling.\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the effects of ivabradine (IVA; 10 \nmg\u00b7kg(-1) \u00b7day(-1) for 90 days) on electrophysiological remodelling in left \natrial (LA), left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) myocytes from \npost-mycardial infarcted (MI) rats, with sham-operated (sham or sham + IVA) rats \nas controls.

Ivabradine reduced HR in both \nMI and sham rats (P < 0.05). In MI + IVA, I(f) overexpression was attenuated and \nHCN4 transcription reduced by 66% and 54% in LV and RV tissue, respectively, \nversus MI rats (all P < 0.05). miR-1 and miR-133, which modulate \npost-transcriptional expression of HCN2 and HCN4 genes, were significantly \nincreased in myocytes from MI + IVA.\nCONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: The beneficial effects of ivabradine may be due to \nthe reversal of electrophysiological cardiac remodelling in post-MI rats by \nreduction of functional overexpression of HCN channels.

MI was \nproduced in adult male Wistar rats. After 2 mo, echocardiography was performed \nbefore the randomization into MI and MI + Iva (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) groups. \nAfter 3 mo of treatment, echocardiography and 24-h telemetry were recorded. \nCardiac collagen, mRNA, and protein expressions of angiotensin-converting enzyme \n(ACE) and ANG II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor were quantified. As a result, at 2 mo \npost-MI, all rats displayed severe congestive HF signs (ejection fraction < \n30%). At 5 mo post-MI, body and heart weights were similar in the MI and MI + \nIva groups. LV ejection fraction and LV end-diastolic pressure were worsened in \nthe MI group, whereas both were improved with Iva. Iva reduced HR by 10.4% (P < \n0.03 vs. MI) and ventricular premature complexes by 89% (P < 0.03) and improved \nHR variability (standard deviation of the RR interval) by 22% (P < 0.05). There \nwere no effects of Iva on PR, QRS, and QT durations. Interstitial fibrosis in \nthe MI-remote LV was markedly reduced by Iva (4.0 +\/- 0.1 vs. 1.8 +\/- 0.1%, P < \n0.005). Increases in ventricular gene and protein expressions of ACE and AT(1) \nreceptor in MI were completely blunted by Iva. In conclusion, these data \nindicated that HR reduction by Iva prevents the worsening of LV dysfunction and \nremodeling that may be related to a downregulation of cardiac \nrenin-angiotensin-aldosterone system transcripts. Such beneficial effects of Iva \non cardiac remodeling open new clinical perspectives for the treatment of severe \nHF.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/ajpheart.00591.2008\nPMID: 19074674 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Previous ChIP-sequencing \nstudies suggested that these marking patterns reflect the nucleosomal landscape. \nBy analyzing ChIP-chip datasets across the human genome in three cell types, we \nhave found that this marking system is far more complex than previously \nobserved. We show here that a range of histone modifications and Pol II are \npreferentially associated with exons. However, there is noticeable cell-type \nspecificity in the degree of exon marking by histone modifications and, \nsurprisingly, this is also reflected in some histone modifications patterns \nshowing biases towards introns. Exon-intron marking is laid down in the absence \nof transcription on silent genes, with some marking biases changing or becoming \nreversed for genes expressed at different levels. Furthermore, the relationship \nof this marking system with splicing is not simple, with only some histone \nmodifications reflecting exon usage\/inclusion, while others mirror patterns of \nexon exclusion. By examining nucleosomal distributions in all three cell types, \nwe demonstrate that these histone modification patterns cannot solely be \naccounted for by differences in nucleosome levels between exons and introns. In \naddition, because of inherent differences between ChIP-chip array and \nChIP-sequencing approaches, these platforms report different nucleosome \ndistribution patterns across the human genome. Our findings confound existing \nviews and point to active cellular mechanisms which dynamically regulate histone \nmodification levels and account for exon-intron marking. We believe that these \nhistone modification patterns provide links between chromatin accessibility, Pol \nII movement and co-transcriptional splicing.\n\nDOI: 10.1371\/journal.pone.0012339\nPMCID: PMC2925886\nPMID: 20808788 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have declared \nthat no competing interests exist."],["1.

Misregulation of splicing is frequently associated to disease, \nwhich imposes a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying splicing \nregulation. Accumulated evidence suggests that multiple trans-acting factors and \ncis-regulatory elements act together to determine tissue-specific splicing \npatterns. Besides, as splicing is often cotranscriptional, a complex picture \nemerges in which splicing regulation not only depends on the balance of splicing \nfactor binding to their pre-mRNA target sites but also on \ntranscription-associated features such as protein recruitment to the \ntranscribing machinery and elongation kinetics. Adding more complexity to the \nsplicing regulation network, recent evidence shows that chromatin structure is \nanother layer of regulation that may act through various mechanisms. These span \nfrom regulation of RNA polymerase II elongation, which ultimately determines \nsplicing decisions, to splicing factor recruitment by specific histone marks. \nChromatin may not only be involved in alternative splicing regulation but in \nconstitutive exon recognition as well. Moreover, splicing was found to be \nnecessary for the proper 'writing' of particular chromatin signatures, giving \nfurther mechanistic support to functional interconnections between splicing, \ntranscription and chromatin structure. These links between chromatin \nconfiguration and splicing raise the intriguing possibility of the existence of \na memory for splicing patterns to be inherited through epigenetic modifications.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\n\nDOI: 10.1002\/wrna.1142\nPMID: 23074139 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

FSHD was mapped to chromosome 4 locus q35, but \nthe gene is not yet known. It is characterised by progressive, often asymmetric, \nselective muscular weakness and great clinical variability. The aim of the study \nwas to analyze 62 FSHD cases from 44 Polish families in which the diagnosis was \nconfirmed by DNA analyses. FSHD diagnosis was based on the clinical findings and \nstandardized investigations confirming primary muscular involvement (EMG, muscle \nbiopsy). DNA analysis was based on EcoRI\/BlnI restriction enzyme digestion \nfollowed by hybridization with P13E-11 molecular probe. In our material, we have \nfound a relatively large percentage (41%) of big deletions (EcoRI\/BlnI fragment \nof 10-15 kb [kilo bases]), which in the majority of cases (67%) was present in \nisolated cases. In 10 families (23%) the phenotype was assessed as severe. These \nare cases with the onset before the age of 10 and fast progression. \"Middle \nsized\" deletions (EcoRI\/BlnI fragment of 16-29 kb) were prevalent in familial \ncases and present in 57% of families. \"Small\" deletion was found in one family \n(EcoRI\/BlnI fragment of 30 kb). Somatic mosaicism was confirmed in one case. De \nnovo mutations were shown in 11% of the examined families. The results of this \nstudy indicate that the bigger the deletion, the more severe the FSHD course, \nhowever there are some exceptions. A similar relationship has been shown by \nprevious research. Molecular analyses are particularly important in atypical and \nsporadic cases. It is the first genetic presentation of a group of patients' \nwith this kind of dystrophy in the Polish population.\n\nPMID: 15307599 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Detection of aberrant methylation in white \nblood cells (WBC) has been suggested as a marker for cancer development, but has \nnot been extensively investigated. This study was carried out to determine \nwhether aberrant methylation in WBC DNA can be used as a surrogate biomarker for \nbreast cancer risk.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Promoter hypermethylation of 8 tumor suppressor genes \n(RASSF1A, APC, HIN1, BRCA1, CYCLIND2, RARbeta, CDH1 and TWIST1) and DNA \nmethylation for three repetitive elements (LINE1, Sat2 and Alu) were analyzed in \ninvasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, paired adjacent normal tissue and WBC \nfrom 40 breast cancer patients by the MethyLight assay. Methylation in WBC from \n40 controls was also analyzed.\nRESULTS: Tumor and adjacent tissues showed frequent hypermethylation for all \ngenes tested, while WBC DNA was rarely hypermethylated. For HIN1, RASSF1A, APC \nand TWIST1, there was agreement between hypermethylation in tumor and adjacent \ntissues (p=0.04, p=0.02, p=0.005 and p<0.0001, respectively). DNA methylation \nfor the three repetitive elements was lower in tumor compared to adjacent tissue \nand WBC DNA. Significant correlations in the methylation of Sat2M1 between tumor \nand adjacent tissues and WBC DNA were found (p<0.0001 and p=0.046, \nrespectively). There was also a significant difference in methylation of Sat2M1 \nbetween cases and controls (p=0.01).\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that further studies of WBC methylation, \nincluding prospective studies, may provide biomarkers of breast cancer risk.\n\nPMCID: PMC3568974\nPMID: 20682973 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

This study was designed to \nevaluate the changes of Alu and LINE-1 hypomethylation during breast cancer \nprogression from normal to pre-invasive lesions and invasive breast cancer \n(IBC), and their relationship with characteristics of IBC. We analyzed the \nmethylation status of Alu and LINE-1 in 145 cases of breast samples including \nnormal breast tissue, atypical ductal hyperplasia\/flat epithelial atypia \n(ADH\/FEA), ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IBC, and another set of 129 cases \nof IBC by pyrosequencing. Alu methylation showed no significant changes during \nmultistep progression of breast cancer, although it tended to decrease during \nthe transition from DCIS to IBC. In contrast, LINE-1 methylation significantly \ndecreased from normal to ADH\/FEA, while it was similar in ADH\/FEA, DCIS and IBC. \nIn IBC, Alu hypomethylation correlated with negative estrogen receptor (ER) \nstatus, and LINE-1 hypomethylation was associated with negative ER status, ERBB2 \n(HER2) amplification and p53 overexpression. Alu and LINE-1 methylation status \nwas significantly different between breast cancer subtypes, and the HER2 \nenriched subtype had lowest methylation levels. In survival analyses, low Alu \nmethylation status tended to be associated with poor disease-free survival of \nthe patients. Our findings suggest that LINE-1 hypomethylation is an early event \nand Alu hypomethylation is probably a late event during breast cancer \nprogression, and prominent hypomethylation of Alu and LINE-1 in HER2 enriched \nsubtype may be related to chromosomal instability of this specific subtype.\n\nDOI: 10.1371\/journal.pone.0100429\nPMCID: PMC4074093\nPMID: 24971511 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have declared \nthat no competing interests exist."]]}

At present, \nlittle is known about cardiac TRH gene transcriptional regulation in the heart. \nHormones and neurotransmitters, including thyroid hormone (T3), glucocorticoids, \ntestosterone, and 5-HT initiate effects not only in the cardiovascular system, \nbut also in the regulation of hypothalamic TRH. To clarify the potential roles \nof these modulators upon the cardiac TRH gene transcription, rat TRH promoter \nactivity was assessed in rat embryonic myocyte cells (H9C2) by transient \ntransfection assays. TRH promoter activity was stimulated significantly by \ndexamethasone (10(-4) M) and testosterone (10(-5) M), and was inhibited by T3 \n(10(-7) M). Interestingly, the neurotransmitter 5-HT stimulated TRH promoter \nactivity in H9C2 cells, but not in HTB-11 cells. To further clarify this \nselective role of 5-HT on TRH promoter transcriptional activity in cardiac \ncells, 5-HT receptor antagonists and agonists were tested. A selective 5-HT2 \nreceptor antagonist blocked 5-HT stimulation, whereas 5-HT agonist analogs \ncaused augmentative effects when combined with 5-HT. Neither 5-HT nor any \nantagonists or agonists influenced H9C2 cell growth or morphology.

TRH stimulates sympathomedullary system to secrete \nepinephrine and sensitize the beta-receptors, but not alpha-receptors. Thus, TRH \nimproves cardiac contractility, cardiac output and hemodynamics during \nhemorrhagic shock. The sensitization of the beta- and dopamine receptors played \nan important role in producing direct peripheral actions of TRH.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/BF02986460\nPMID: 1979356 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Overexpression of BRD7 inhibits NPC cell growth and cell cycle by \ntranscriptionally regulating the cell cycle related genes. BRD7 contains a \nbromodomain that is found in many chromatin-associated proteins and in nearly \nall known nuclear histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and plays an important role \nin chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation. Here, we report the \nsolution structure of BRD7 bromodomain determined by NMR spectroscopy, and its \nbinding specificity revealed by NMR titration with several acetylated histone \npeptides. We find that BRD7 bromodomain contains the typical left-handed \nfour-helix bundle topology, and can bind with weak affinity to lysine-acetylated \npeptides derived from histone H3 with K9 or K14 acetylated and from histone H4 \nwith K8, K12 or K16 acetylated.

Here we report the solution structure of the bromodomain of the \nHAT co-activator P\/CAF (p300\/CBP-associated factor). The structure reveals an \nunusual left-handed up-and-down four-helix bundle. In addition, we show by a \ncombination of structural and site-directed mutagenesis studies that \nbromodomains can interact specifically with acetylated lysine, making them the \nfirst known protein modules to do so. The nature of the recognition of \nacetyl-lysine by the P\/CAF bromodomain is similar to that of acetyl-CoA by \nhistone acetyltransferase.

This study describes some of the endoscopic and \npathological characteristics in a group of children with developmental disorders \n(affected children) that are associated with behavioral regression and bowel \nsymptoms, and compares them with pediatric controls.\nMETHODS: Ileocolonoscopy and biopsy were performed on 60 affected children \n(median age 6 yr, range 3-16; 53 male). Developmental diagnoses were autism (50 \npatients), Asperger's syndrome (five), disintegrative disorder (two), attention \ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (one), schizophrenia (one), and dyslexia \n(one). Severity of ileal LNH was graded (0-3) in both affected children and 37 \ndevelopmentally normal controls (median age 11 yr, range 2-13 yr) who were \ninvestigated for possible inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Tissue sections were \nreviewed by three pathologists and scored on a standard proforma. Data were \ncompared with ileocolonic biopsies from 22 histologically normal children \n(controls) and 20 children with ulcerative colitis (UC), scored in an identical \nmanner. Gut pathogens were sought routinely.\nRESULTS: Ileal LNH was present in 54 of 58 (93%) affected children and in five \nof 35 (14.3%) controls (p < 0.001). Colonic LNH was present in 18 of 60 (30%) \naffected children and in two of 37 (5.4%) controls (p < 0.01). Histologically, \nreactive follicular hyperplasia was present in 46 of 52 (88.5%) ileal biopsies \nfrom affected children and in four of 14 (29%) with UC, but not in non-IBD \ncontrols (p < 0.01). Active ileitis was present in four of 51 (8%) affected \nchildren but not in controls. Chronic colitis was identified in 53 of 60 (88%) \naffected children compared with one of 22 (4.5%) controls and in 20 of 20 (100%) \nwith UC. Scores of frequency and severity of inflammation were significantly \ngreater in both affected children and those with UC, compared with controls (p < \n0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: A new variant of inflammatory bowel disease is present in this \ngroup of children with developmental disorders.\n\nDOI: 10.1111\/j.1572-0241.2000.03248.x\nPMID: 11007230 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

The association between autism and esophageal achalasia has not been \ndescribed in literature yet. We report our experience with three cases of \nautistic children we recently treated for esophageal achalasia. In the first \ncase (a 14-year-old male), achalasia was diagnosed with barium swallow and \nesophageal manometry and was successfully treated with three pneumatic \nendoscopic dilatations (follow-up: 3 years). In the second case (a 12-year-old \nfemale), achalasia was diagnosed with barium swallow and esophageal manometry \nand was treated with Heller myotomy after two unsuccessful pneumatic endoscopic \nattempts (follow-up: 3 months). In the last case, a 15-year-old male underwent \nbarium swallow and endoscopy that confirmed achalasia. He was treated with \nHeller myotomy, and he is asymptomatic at a 6-month follow-up. To our knowledge, \nthis is the first report of a possible association between autism and esophageal \nachalasia. Because of the rarity of both diseases, their association in the same \npatient is unlikely to be casual even if speculation on their common etiology is \nimpossible at present. This finding needs further confirmation, but it is \nsufficient, in our opinion, to indicate proper evaluation with barium swallow \nand\/or manometry in any autistic children with eating difficulty.\n\n\u00a9 2012 Copyright the Authors.

Despite adherence to multiple available medical \ntherapies, a significant proportion of patients have persistent blood pressure \nelevation, a condition termed resistant hypertension. Recent recognition of the \nimportance of the renal sympathetic and somatic nerves in modulating blood \npressure and the development of a novel procedure that selectively removes these \ncontributors to resistant hypertension represents an opportunity to provide \nclinically meaningful benefit across wide and varied patient populations. Early \nclinical evaluation with catheter-based, selective renal sympathetic denervation \nin patients with resistant hypertension has mechanistically correlated \nsympathetic efferent denervation with decreased renal norepinephrine spillover \nand renin activity, increased renal plasma flow, and has demonstrated clinically \nsignificant, sustained reductions in blood pressure.

In this model, the c-Jun N-terminal \nkinase (JNK) induces pro-apoptotic genes through the c-Jun\/activator protein 1 \n(AP-1) transcription factor. On the other side, a survival pathway initiated by \nlithium leads to repression of pro-apoptotic c-Jun\/AP-1 target genes without \ninterfering with JNK activity. Yet, the mechanism by which lithium inhibits \nc-Jun activity remains to be elucidated. Here, we used this model system to \nstudy the regulation and function of site-specific c-Jun phosphorylation at the \nS63 and T91\/T93 JNK sites in neuronal cell death. We found that TK-deprivation \nled to c-Jun multiphosphorylation at all three JNK sites. However, \nimmunofluorescence analysis of c-Jun phosphorylation at single cell level \nrevealed that the S63 site was phosphorylated in all c-Jun-expressing cells, \nwhereas the response of T91\/T93 phosphorylation was more sensitive, mirroring \nthe switch-like apoptotic response of CGCs. Conversely, lithium prevented T91T93 \nphosphorylation and cell death without affecting the S63 site, suggesting that \nT91T93 phosphorylation triggers c-Jun pro-apoptotic activity. Accordingly, a \nc-Jun mutant lacking the T95 priming site for T91\/93 phosphorylation protected \nCGCs from apoptosis, whereas it was able to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 \ncells. Vice versa, a c-Jun mutant bearing aspartate substitution of T95 \noverwhelmed lithium-mediate protection of CGCs from TK-deprivation, validating \nthat inhibition of T91\/T93\/T95 phosphorylation underlies the effect of lithium \non cell death. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed multiphosphorylation of \nc-Jun at T91\/T93\/T95 in cells. Moreover, JNK phosphorylated recombinant c-Jun at \nT91\/T93 in a T95-dependent manner. On the basis of our results, we propose that \nT91\/T93\/T95 multiphosphorylation of c-Jun functions as a sensitivity amplifier \nof the JNK cascade, setting the threshold for c-Jun pro-apoptotic activity in \nneuronal cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1038\/cddis.2013.381\nPMCID: PMC3824690\nPMID: 24113186 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

A novel compound \nRY10-4 which has the similar structure close to protoapigenone showed better \nantitumor activity. Treatment with RY10-4 inhibited the expression of \npro-caspase-3, pro-caspase-9, Bcl-2 as well as phosphorylation of signal \ntransducer and activator of transcription-3 (p-STAT3). It also reduced the \nexpressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), matrix metalloproteinase-9 \n(MMP-9) and increases the expressions of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich \nprotein with kazal motifs (RECK), as well as tissue inhibitor of \nmetalloproteinase (TIMP) via inhibiting STAT3 by activating the \nmitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the \np38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)) in A549 cells treated with \nRY10-4. Moreover, the cytotoxic effect of RY10-4 was induction of apoptosis in \nA549 cells by enhancing production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

To \nidentify such modified and shortened protease-generated neo-N-termini on a \nproteome-wide basis, we developed a whole protein isobaric tag for relative and \nabsolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling method that simultaneously labels and \nblocks all primary amines including protein N- termini and lysine side chains. \nBlocking lysines limits trypsin cleavage to arginine, which effectively \nelongates the proteolytically truncated peptides for improved MS\/MS analysis and \npeptide identification. Incorporating iTRAQ whole protein labeling with terminal \namine isotopic labeling of substrates (iTRAQ-TAILS) to enrich the N-terminome by \nnegative selection of the blocked mature original N-termini and neo-N-termini \nhas many advantages. It enables simultaneous characterization of the natural \nN-termini of proteins, their N-terminal modifications, and proteolysis product \nand cleavage site identification. Furthermore, iTRAQ-TAILS also enables \nmultiplex N-terminomics analysis of up to eight samples and allows for \nquantification in MS2 mode, thus preventing an increase in spectral complexity \nand extending proteome coverage by signal amplification of low abundance \nproteins. We compared the substrate degradomes of two closely related matrix \nmetalloproteinases, MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B), in fibroblast \nsecreted proteins. Among 3,152 unique N-terminal peptides identified \ncorresponding to 1,054 proteins, we detected 201 cleavage products for MMP-2 and \nunexpectedly only 19 for the homologous MMP-9 under identical conditions. Novel \nsubstrates identified and biochemically validated include insulin-like growth \nfactor binding protein-4, complement C1r component A, galectin-1, \ndickkopf-related protein-3, and thrombospondin-2. Hence, N-terminomics analyses \nusing iTRAQ-TAILS links gelatinases with new mechanisms of action in \nangiogenesis and reveals unpredicted restrictions in substrate repertoires for \nthese two very similar proteases.\n\nDOI: 10.1074\/mcp.M000050-MCP201\nPMCID: PMC2871422\nPMID: 20305284 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Since 1989, there has \nbeen an exponential increase in AEDs with 23 currently licensed for clinical \nuse, and recently, there has been renewed and extensive interest in the use of \nsaliva as an alternative matrix for AED TDM. The advantages of saliva include \nthe fact that for many AEDs it reflects the free (pharmacologically active) \nconcentration in serum; it is readily sampled, can be sampled repetitively, and \nsampling is noninvasive; does not require the expertise of a phlebotomist; and \nis preferred by many patients, particularly children and the elderly. For each \nAED, this review summarizes the key pharmacokinetic characteristics relevant to \nthe practice of TDM, discusses the use of other biological matrices with \nparticular emphasis on saliva and the evidence that saliva concentration \nreflects those in serum. Also discussed are the indications for salivary AED \nTDM, the key factors to consider when saliva sampling is to be undertaken, and \nfinally, a practical protocol is described so as to enable AED TDM to be applied \noptimally and effectively in the clinical setting. Overall, there is compelling \nevidence that salivary TDM can be usefully applied so as to optimize the \ntreatment of epilepsy with carbamazepine, clobazam, ethosuximide, gabapentin, \nlacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, \nprimidone, topiramate, and zonisamide.

LCM has demonstrated antiepileptic effectiveness in different \nrodent seizure models and antinociceptive potential in experimental animal \nmodels that reflect distinct types and symptoms of neuropathic as well as \nchronic inflammatory pain. Recent results suggest that LCM has a dual mode of \naction underlying its anticonvulsant and analgesic activity. It was found that \nLCM selectively enhances slow inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels \nwithout affecting fast inactivation. Furthermore, employing proteomic \naffinity-labeling techniques, collapsin-response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2 \nalias DRP-2) was identified as a binding partner. Follow-up experiments \nconfirmed a functional interaction of LCM with CRMP-2 in vitro. LCM did not \ninhibit or induce a wide variety of cytochrome P450 enzymes at therapeutic \nconcentrations. In safety pharmacology and toxicology studies conducted in mice, \nrats, rabbits, and dogs, LCM was well tolerated. Either none or only minor side \neffects were observed in safety studies involving the central nervous, \nrespiratory, gastrointestinal, and renal systems and there is no indication of \nabuse liability. Repeated dose toxicity studies demonstrated that after either \nintravenous or oral administration of LCM the adverse events were reversible and \nconsisted mostly of exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects on the CNS. No genotoxic \nor carcinogenic effects were observed in vivo, and LCM showed a favorable \nprofile in reproductive and developmental animal studies. Currently, LCM is in a \nlate stage of clinical development as an adjunctive treatment for patients with \nuncontrolled partial-onset seizures, and it is being assessed as monotherapy in \npatients with painful diabetic neuropathy. Further trials to identify LCM's \npotential in pain and for other indications have been initiated.\n\nDOI: 10.1111\/j.1527-3458.2007.00001.x\nPMCID: PMC6494128\nPMID: 17461888 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Ewing's sarcoma family tumors \n(ESFTs), which include peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), are \ncharacterized by chromosomal translocations that generate fusions between the \nEWS gene and ETS-family transcription factors, most commonly FLI1. The EWS-FLI1 \nfusion oncoprotein represents an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of \nEwing's sarcoma. The cell of origin of ESFT and the molecular mechanisms by \nwhich EWS-FLI1 mediates tumorigenesis remain unknown, and few animal models of \nEwing's sarcoma exist. Here, we report the use of zebrafish as a vertebrate \nmodel of EWS-FLI1 function and tumorigenesis. Mosaic expression of the human \nEWS-FLI1 fusion protein in zebrafish caused the development of tumors with \nhistology strongly resembling that of human Ewing's sarcoma. The incidence of \ntumors increased in a p53 mutant background, suggesting that the p53 pathway \nsuppresses EWS-FLI1-driven tumorigenesis. Gene expression profiling of the \nzebrafish tumors defined a set of genes that might be regulated by EWS-FLI1, \nincluding the zebrafish ortholog of a crucial EWS-FLI1 target gene in humans. \nStable zebrafish transgenic lines expressing EWS-FLI1 under the control of the \nheat-shock promoter exhibit altered embryonic development and defective \nconvergence and extension, suggesting that EWS-FLI1 interacts with conserved \ndevelopmental pathways. These results indicate that functional targets of \nEWS-FLI1 that mediate tumorigenesis are conserved from zebrafish to human and \nprovide a novel context in which to study the function of this fusion oncogene.\n\nDOI: 10.1242\/dmm.007401\nPMCID: PMC3255547\nPMID: 21979944 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

After a \n12-h fast, 15 young men (mean \u00b1 SD, age 24.4 \u00b1 1.7 yrs, maximal oxygen uptake \n47.0 \u00b1 6.5 mL\/kg\/min) participated in three 160 min trials: (1) rope skipping \nexercise (295 \u00b1 40 kcal, 3 sets \u00d7 10 min with 5-min interval, then rested for \n120 min); (2) bicycle ergometer exercise (288 \u00b1 36 kcal, 3 sets \u00d7 10 min with \n5-min interval, then rested for 120 min); (3) control (rested for 160 min). \nRatings of perceived hunger and acylated ghrelin were suppressed and total \npeptide YY (PYY) were increased during and immediately after exercise in both \nexercise trials, but glucagon liked peptide-1 was not changed. Furthermore, \nsuppressed hunger during rope skipping exercise was greater than that during \nbicycle ergometer exercise, but there were no differences in acylated ghrelin \nand total PYY. These results indicate that weight-bearing exercise has a greater \nexercise-induced appetite suppressive effect compared with non-weight-bearing \nexercise, and both forms of exercise lowered acylated ghrelin and increased \ntotal PYY, but the changes did not differ significantly between exercise modes.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In \naddition, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation of km23 is TGFbeta-dependent, \nin that EGF was unable to phosphorylate km23. Further, the kinase activity of \nboth TGFbeta receptors appears to play a role in the TGFbeta-mediated \nphosphorylation of km23, although TGFbeta RII kinase activity is absolutely \nrequired for km23 phosphorylation. Blockade of km23 using small interfering RNAs \nsignificantly decreased key TGFbeta responses, including induction of \nfibronectin expression and inhibition of cell growth. Thus, our results \ndemonstrate that km23 is required for TGFbeta induction of fibronectin \nexpression and is necessary, but not sufficient, for TGFbeta-mediated growth \ninhibition.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.cellsig.2005.02.004\nPMID: 15925487 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Here we describe another member of the \nkm23\/DYNLRB\/LC7\/robl family of DLCs, termed km23-2, which is also involved in \nTGFbeta signaling. We show not only that TGFbeta stimulates the interaction of \nkm23-2 (DYNLRB2) with TGFbeta receptor II (TbetaRII) but also that TGFbeta \nregulates the interaction between km23-2 and endogenous TbetaRII in vivo. In \naddition, TGFbeta treatment causes km23-2 phosphorylation, whereas a \nkinase-deficient form of TbetaRII prevents km23-2 phosphorylation. In contrast \nto the km23-1 isoform, blockade of km23-2 expression using small interfering \nRNAs (siRNAs) decreased key TGFbeta\/Smad3-specific responses, including the \ninduction of both plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene expression and \np21 protein expression. Blockade of km23-1 expression had no effect on these two \nmajor TGFbeta\/Smad3 responses under similar conditions. Further, km23-2 was \nrequired for TGFbeta stimulation of Smad3-dependent Smad-binding element \n(SBE)2-Luc transcriptional activity, but not for TGFbeta stimulation of \nSmad2-dependent activin responsive element (ARE)-Lux transcriptional activity. \nIn order to assess the mechanisms underlying the preferential stimulation of \nSmad3- versus Smad2-specific TGFbeta responses, immunoprecipitation (IP)\/blot \nanalyses were performed, which demonstrate that TGFbeta stimulated preferential \ncomplex formation of km23-2 with Smad3, relative to Smad2. Collectively, our \nfindings indicate that km23-2 is required for Smad3-dependent TGFbeta signaling. \nMore importantly, we demonstrate that km23-2 has functions in TGFbeta signaling \nthat are distinct from those for km23-1. This is the first report to describe a \ndifferential requirement for unique isoforms of a specific DLC family in \nSmad-specific TGFbeta signaling.\n\nDOI: 10.1002\/jcp.21910\nPMCID: PMC2881827\nPMID: 19711352 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

However, a beneficial effect of IAT on \nfunctional recovery in patients with acute ischemic stroke remains unproven. The \naim of this study is to assess the effect of IAT on functional outcome in \npatients with acute ischemic stroke. Additionally, we aim to assess the safety \nof IAT, and the effect on recanalization of different mechanical treatment \nmodalities.\nMETHODS\/DESIGN: A multicenter randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome \nassessment. The active comparison is IAT versus no IAT. IAT may consist of \nintra-arterial thrombolysis with alteplase or urokinase, mechanical treatment or \nboth. Mechanical treatment refers to retraction, aspiration, sonolysis, or use \nof a retrievable stent (stent-retriever). Patients with a relevant intracranial \nproximal arterial occlusion of the anterior circulation, who can be treated \nwithin 6\u00a0hours after stroke onset, are eligible. Treatment effect will be \nestimated with ordinal logistic regression (shift analysis); 500 patients will \nbe included in the trial for a power of 80% to detect a shift leading to a \ndecrease in dependency in 10% of treated patients. The primary outcome is the \nscore on the modified Rankin scale at 90\u00a0days. Secondary outcomes are the \nNational Institutes of Health stroke scale score at 24\u00a0hours, vessel patency at \n24\u00a0hours, infarct size on day 5, and the occurrence of major bleeding during the \nfirst 5\u00a0days.\nDISCUSSION: If IAT leads to a 10% absolute reduction in poor outcome after \nstroke, careful implementation of the intervention could save approximately 1% \nof all new stroke cases from death or disability annually.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR1804 (7 May 2009)\/ISRCTN10888758 (24 July 2012).\n\nDOI: 10.1186\/1745-6215-15-343\nPMCID: PMC4162915\nPMID: 25179366 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Endovascular therapies were associated with \nsignificantly improved outcomes compared with medical management (OR 1.67, 95% \nCI 1.29 to 1.16, p=0.0001) for patients with LVO (dataset 1).

One \nof the possible explanations for this phenomenon is viscerovisceral \ncross-sensitization, in which increased nociceptive input from an inflamed \npelvic organ sensitizes neurons that receive convergent input to the same dorsal \nroot ganglion (DRG) from an unaffected visceral organ. Nociception induces \nup-regulation of cellular mechanisms such as phosphorylated extracellular \nsignal-regulated kinase (pERK) and substance P (SP), neurotransmitters \nassociated with induced pain sensation. The purpose of this study was to \ndetermine, in a rodent model, whether uterine inflammation increased the number \nof pERK- and SP-positive neurons that received input from both the uterus and \nthe colon. Cell bodies of colonic and uterine DRG were retrogradely labeled with \nfluorescent tracer dyes microinjected into the colon\/rectum and into the uterus. \nGanglia were harvested for fluorescent microscopy to identify positively stained \nneurons. Approximately 6% of neurons were colon specific and 10% uterus \nspecific. Among these uterus- or colon-specific neurons, up to 3-5% of DRG \nneurons in the lumbosacral neurons (L1-S3 levels) received input from both \nvisceral organs. Uterine inflammation increased the number of pERK- and \nSP-immunoreactive DRG neurons innervating specifically colon, or innervating \nspecifically uterus, and those innervating both organs. These results suggest \nthat a localized inflammation activates primary visceral afferents, regardless \nof whether they innervate the affected organ.

Therefore, the \npresent study aimed to examine the increase in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic \npeptide (NT-proBNP) and relations to cardiac troponin I and T (cTnI, cTnT) \nelevations after prolonged strenuous exercise in a large cohort of athletes.\nMETHODS: We examined exercise-induced changes in NT-proBNP, cTnI, and cTnT in \n105 obviously healthy endurance athletes (40 +\/- 8 years) before and after \nprolonged strenuous exercise. Blood samples were taken before, 15 minutes, and 3 \nhours after a marathon (n = 46), a 100-km run (n = 14), and a mountain bike \nmarathon (n = 45).\nRESULTS: Eighty-one of 105 athletes exceeded the upper reference limit of \nNT-proBNP (males\/females 88:153 ng\/L) after exercise. NT-proBNP increased in all \n3 events (P < .001) with the highest increase in the 100-km runners (median \nincrease 200 ng\/L; 25th\/75th percentile 115\/770 ng\/L), which differed from the \nincrease in the marathon (97 ng\/L; 36\/254 ng\/L) or the mountain bike marathon \n(78 ng\/L; 37\/196 ng\/L) (P < .01). Cardiac troponin I exceeded 0.04 microg\/L in \n74%; cTnT exceeded 0.01 microg\/L in 47% of athletes after exercise. NT-proBNP \nwas not related to exercise-induced increases in cTnI or cTnT, but correlated \nwith exercise time (r = 0.55, P < .001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Increases in NT-proBNP can be found in a major part of obviously \nhealthy athletes after prolonged strenuous exercise. The release of BNP during \nand after exercise may not result from myocardial damage but may have \ncytoprotective and growth-regulating effects. The different nature of \nexercise-induced increases in BNP and cardiac troponins has to be elucidated in \nthe future.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.ahj.2005.01.051\nPMID: 16338248 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

BNP is a sensitive marker of cardiac failure and its measurement in \nblood could be useful to the diagnosis and the treatment of this disease. \nSporting activities, especially endurance ones, can induce cardiac problems, \nowing to the high workload for the myocardium during long and ultralong heavy \neffort. There are 2 papers describing the behavior of BNP in endurance events. \nBNP was elevated in marathoners, immediately after the race and also after 4 h. \nWe studied the behavior of BNP in the triathlon, which is a complex sport \ncharacterized by 3 different activities (swimming, cycling, running).\nMETHODS: We recruited 49 athletes, all males, except for 4 females; 2 athletes \ndid not finish the race and were not included in the statistical analysis in 2 \ndifferent competitions. In these subjects we measured BNP using an immunological \nmethod before and after a triathlon.\nRESULTS: No statistical significance between BNP values, before and after the \ntriathlon, was found.\nCONCLUSIONS: We found no significant differences between pre- and \npostcompetition BNP values. Moreover, the range of values in both the blood \ndrawings are similar of those of the general population, representing the \nbiological variability of the analyte. The values in regularly trained \nathletes,, are not different from the general population and BNP is not modified \nby a triathlon, a typical endurance sport performance. We can underline that BNP \nincreases in plasma are induced by heavy pathologies and are not influenced by \nphysical activities, even strenuous ones.\n\nPMID: 16446686 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Vertebrate development is constrained into only \nvery few final or common developmental paths; therefore, no developmental \nanomaly seen in humans is unique to (\"pathognomonic\" of) one syndrome. Thus, it \nis not surprising that prenatal overgrowth occurs in several syndromes, \nincluding the Sotos and Weaver syndromes. Are they sufficiently different in \nother respects to allow the postulation of locus (rather than allele) \nheterogeneity? Phenotypic data in both conditions are biased because of \nascertainment of propositi, and the apparent differences between them may be \nentirely artificial as they were between the G and BBB syndromes. On the other \nhand, the Sotos syndrome may be a cancer syndrome, the Weaver syndrome not \n(though a neuroblastoma was reported in the latter); in the former there is also \nremarkably advanced dental maturation rarely commented on in the latter. In \nWeaver syndrome there are more conspicuous contractures and a facial appearance \nthat experts find convincingly different from that of Sotos individuals. \nNevertheless, the hypothesis of locus heterogeneity is testable; at the moment \nwe are inclined to favor the hypothesis of allele heterogeneity.

Weaver syndrome is characterized by the same \ncriteria but has its own distinctive facial gestalt. Recently, a 2.2-Mb \nchromosome 5q35 microdeletion, encompassing NSD1, was reported as the major \ncause of Sotos syndrome, with intragenic NSD1 mutations identified in a minority \nof cases. We evaluated 75 patients with childhood overgrowth, for intragenic \nmutations and large deletions of NSD1. The series was phenotypically scored into \nfour groups, prior to the molecular analyses: the phenotype in group 1 (n=37) \nwas typical of Sotos syndrome; the phenotype in group 2 (n=13) was Sotos-like \nbut with some atypical features; patients in group 3 (n=7) had Weaver syndrome, \nand patients in group 4 (n=18) had an overgrowth condition that was neither \nSotos nor Weaver syndrome. We detected three deletions and 32 mutations (13 \nframeshift, 8 nonsense, 2 splice-site, and 9 missense) that are likely to impair \nNSD1 functions. The truncating mutations were spread throughout NSD1, but there \nwas evidence of clustering of missense mutations in highly conserved functional \ndomains between exons 13 and 23. There was a strong correlation between presence \nof an NSD1 alteration and clinical phenotype, in that 28 of 37 (76%) patients in \ngroup 1 had NSD1 mutations or deletions, whereas none of the patients in group 4 \nhad abnormalities of NSD1. Three patients with Weaver syndrome had NSD1 \nmutations, all between amino acids 2142 and 2184. We conclude that intragenic \nmutations of NSD1 are the major cause of Sotos syndrome and account for some \nWeaver syndrome cases but rarely occur in other childhood overgrowth phenotypes.\n\nDOI: 10.1086\/345647\nPMCID: PMC378618\nPMID: 12464997 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for \nthe first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation \nof long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed \ntranscribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Interestingly, several \nhypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named 'hypoxia-induced noncoding \nultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical \nsamples from colon cancer patients. We show that these T-UCRs are predominantly \nnuclear and that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is at least partly \nresponsible for the induction of several members of this group. One specific \nHINCUT, uc.475 (or HINCUT-1) is part of a retained intron of the host \nprotein-coding gene, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, which is \noverexpressed in epithelial cancer types. Consistent with the hypothesis that \nT-UCRs have important function in tumor formation, HINCUT-1 supports cell \nproliferation specifically under hypoxic conditions and may be critical for \noptimal O-GlcNAcylation of proteins when oxygen tension is limiting. Our data \ngives a first glimpse of a novel functional hypoxic network comprising \nprotein-coding transcripts and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) from the T-UCRs category.\n\nDOI: 10.1038\/cdd.2013.119\nPMCID: PMC3824588\nPMID: 24037088 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Traditionally, spontaneous \nhydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine has been invoked as the \ncause of this phenomenon. We show here that a bacterial cytosine \nmethyltransferase can convert 5-methylcytosine in DNA to thymine and that this \nreaction creates a mutational hot spot at a site of DNA methylation. The \nreaction is fairly insensitive to the methyl donor in the reaction, \nS-adenosylmethionine. In many cancers, the most frequent class of mutations is C \nto T changes within CG dinucleotides of the tumor suppressor gene p53.

The only current potentially curative option, allogeneic \nhematopoietic stem cell transplant, is recommended for few patients.

Identification of a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 \n(JAK2) gene (JAK2 V617F) in more than half of all patients with MF has prompted \nthe discovery and clinical development of inhibitors that target JAK2. Although \ntreatment with JAK2 inhibitors has been shown to improve symptom response and \nquality of life in patients with MF, these drugs do not alter the underlying \ndisease; therefore, novel therapies are needed. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling \npathway has been shown to play a role in normal hematopoiesis and in the \ntumorigenesis of hematologic malignancies. Moreover, inhibitors of the Hh \npathway have been shown to inhibit growth and self-renewal capacity in \npreclinical models of MF. In a mouse model of MF, combined inhibition of the Hh \nand JAK pathways reduced JAK2 mutant allele burden, reduced bone marrow \nfibrosis, and reduced white blood cell and platelet counts. Preliminary clinical \ndata also suggest that inhibition of the Hh pathway, alone or in combination \nwith JAK2 inhibition, may enable disease modification in patients with MF. \nFuture studies, including one combining the Hh pathway inhibitor sonidegib and \nthe JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, are underway in patients with MF and will inform \nwhether this combination approach can lead to true disease modification.\n\nDOI: 10.1186\/1756-8722-7-18\nPMCID: PMC3975838\nPMID: 24598114 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Hedgehog pathway signalling is aberrantly activated in around 95% of \ntumours. We assessed the antitumour activity of sonidegib, a Hedgehog signalling \ninhibitor, in patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma.\nMETHODS: BOLT is an ongoing multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 2 \ntrial. Eligible patients had locally advanced basal cell carcinoma not amenable \nto curative surgery or radiation or metastatic basal cell carcinoma. Patients \nwere randomised via an automated system in a 1:2 ratio to receive 200 mg or 800 \nmg oral sonidegib daily, stratified by disease, histological subtype, and \ngeographical region. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who \nachieved an objective response, assessed in the primary efficacy analysis \npopulation (patients with fully assessable locally advanced disease and all \nthose with metastatic disease) with data collected up to 6 months after \nrandomisation of the last patient. This trial is registered with \nClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01327053.\nFINDINGS: Between July 20, 2011, and Jan 10, 2013, we enrolled 230 patients, 79 \nin the 200 mg sonidegib group, and 151 in the 800 mg sonidegib group. Median \nfollow-up was 13\u00b79 months (IQR 10\u00b71-17\u00b73). In the primary efficacy analysis \npopulation, 20 (36%, 95% CI 24-50) of 55 patients receiving 200 mg sonidegib and \n39 (34%, 25-43) of 116 receiving 800 mg sonidegib achieved an objective \nresponse. In the 200 mg sonidegib group, 18 (43%, 95% CI 28-59) patients who \nachieved an objective response, as assessed by central review, were noted among \nthe 42 with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma and two (15%, 2-45) among the \n13 with metastatic disease. In the 800 mg group, 35 (38%, 95% CI 28-48) of 93 \npatients with locally advanced disease had an objective response, as assessed by \ncentral review, as did four (17%, 5-39) of 23 with metastatic disease. Fewer \nadverse events leading to dose interruptions or reductions (25 [32%] of 79 \npatients vs 90 [60%] of 150) or treatment discontinuation (17 [22%] vs 54 [36%]) \noccurred in patients in the 200 mg group than in the 800 mg group. The most \ncommon grade 3-4 adverse events were raised creatine kinase (five [6%] in the \n200 mg group vs 19 [13%] in the 800 mg group) and lipase concentration (four \n[5%] vs eight [5%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (14%) of 79 patients \nin the 200 mg group and 45 (30%) of 150 patients in the 800 mg group.\nINTERPRETATION: The benefit-to-risk profile of 200 mg sonidegib might offer a \nnew treatment option for patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma, a \npopulation that is difficult to treat.\nFUNDING: Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that retroviral transduction of FA(C) lymphoblasts with \nwild-type FAC cDNA resulted in normalization of the cell cycle response to \nlow-dose mitomycin C (MMC).

In all cases the cell cycle response of FA(C) and normal \nlymphoblasts to these two agents were identical. Based on these studies we \nconclude that the aberrant G2\/M arrest that typifies the response of FA(C) cells \nto low doses of cross-linking agents does not represent an abnormal cell cycle \nresponse but instead represents a normal cellular response to the excessive DNA \ndamage that results in FA(C) cells following exposure to low doses of \ncross-linking agents.\n\nPMID: 9414295 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

All of these R-loops arise upon generation of a G-rich RNA strand \nby an RNA polymerase upon transcription of a C-rich DNA template strand. These \nR-loops are of significant length. For example, the R-loop at the col E1 origin \nof replication appears to be about 140 bp. Our own lab has focused on class \nswitch regions, where the R-loops can extend well over a kilobase in length. \nHere, methods are described for detection and analysis of R-loops in vitro and \nin vivo.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/S0076-6879(05)09018-X\nPMID: 16793409 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Many of these repeats are bidirectionally transcribed, allowing for \nsingle- and double-R-loop configurations, where either or both DNA strands may \nbe RNA-bound. R-loops can trigger repeat instability at (CTG)\u00b7(CAG) repeats, but \nthe mechanism of this is unclear. We demonstrate R-loop-mediated instability \nthrough processing of R-loops by HeLa and human neuron-like cell extracts. \nDouble-R-loops induced greater instability than single-R-loops. Pre-treatment \nwith RNase H only partially suppressed instability, supporting a model in which \nR-loops directly generate instability by aberrant processing, or via slipped-DNA \nformation upon RNA removal and its subsequent aberrant processing. Slipped-DNAs \nwere observed to form following removal of the RNA from R-loops. Since \ntranscriptionally-induced R-loops can occur in the absence of DNA replication, \nR-loop processing may be a source of repeat instability in the brain. \nDouble-R-loop formation and processing to instability was extended to the \nexpanded C9orf72 (GGGGCC)\u00b7(GGCCCC) repeats, known to cause amyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis and frontotemporal dementia, providing the first suggestion through \nwhich these repeats may become unstable. These findings provide a mechanistic \nbasis for R-loop-mediated instability at disease-associated repeats.\n\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.

We performed actomyosin ATPase and spectroscopic solution studies \nto investigate the molecular properties of these mutations. Actomyosin ATPase \nactivity was measured as a function of [Ca(2+)] utilizing reconstituted thin \nfilaments (TFs) with 50% mutant and 50% wild type (WT) and 100% mutant cardiac \ntroponin (cTn) complexes: A8V, C84Y, and D145E increased the Ca(2+) sensitivity \nwith only A8V demonstrating lowered Ca(2+) sensitization at the 50% ratio when \ncompared with 100%; E134D was the same as WT at both ratios. Of these four \nmutants, only D145E showed increased ATPase activation in the presence of \nCa(2+). None of the mutants affected ATPase inhibition or the binding of cTn to \nthe TF measured by co-sedimentation. Only D145E increased the Ca(2+) affinity of \nsite II measured by 2-(4'-(2''-iodoacetamido)phenyl)aminonaphthalene-6-sulfonic \nacid fluorescence in isolated cTnC or the cTn complex. In the presence of the \nTF, only A8V was further sensitized to Ca(2+). Circular dichroism measurements \nin different metal-bound states of the isolated cTnCs showed changes in the \nsecondary structure of A8V, C84Y, and D145E, whereas E134D was the same as WT. \nPyMol modeling of each cTnC mutant within the cTn complex revealed potential for \nlocal changes in the tertiary structure of A8V, C84Y, and D145E. Our results \nindicate that 1) three of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cTnC mutants increased \nthe Ca(2+) sensitivity of the myofilament; 2) the effects of the mutations on \nthe Ca(2+) affinity of isolated cTnC, cTn, and TF are not sufficient to explain \nthe large Ca(2+) sensitivity changes seen in reconstituted and fiber assays; and \n3) changes in the secondary structure of the cTnC mutants may contribute to \nmodified protein-protein interactions along the sarcomere lattice disrupting the \ncoupling between the cross-bridge and Ca(2+) binding to cTnC.\n\nDOI: 10.1074\/jbc.M109.007021\nPMCID: PMC2707221\nPMID: 19439414 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Many of these \nmutations appear to affect the functional properties of cardiac troponin C \n(cTnC), i.e., by increasing the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of contraction, a hallmark of \nHCM, yet surprisingly, prior to this report, cTnC had not been classified as a \nHCM-susceptibility gene. In this study, we show that mutations occurring in the \nhuman cTnC (HcTnC) gene (TNNC1) have the same prevalence (~0.4%) as well \nestablished HCM-susceptibility genes that encode other sarcomeric proteins. \nComprehensive open reading frame\/splice site mutation analysis of TNNC1 \nperformed on 1025 unrelated HCM patients enrolled over the last 10 years \nrevealed novel missense mutations in TNNC1: A8V, C84Y, E134D, and D145E. \nFunctional studies with these recombinant HcTnC HCM mutations showed increased \nCa(2+) sensitivity of force development (A8V, C84Y and D145E) and force recovery \n(A8V and D145E). These results are consistent with the HCM functional phenotypes \nseen with other sarcomeric-HCM mutations (E134D showed no changes in these \nparameters). This is the largest cohort analysis of TNNC1 in HCM that details \nthe discovery of at least three novel HCM-associated mutations and more strongly \nlinks TNNC1 to HCM along with functional evidence that supports a central role \nfor its involvement in the disease. This study may help to further define TNNC1 \nas an HCM-susceptibility gene, a classification that has already been \nestablished for the other members of the troponin complex.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.yjmcc.2008.05.003\nPMCID: PMC2627482\nPMID: 18572189 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

In \nclinical trials, sham treatment is often given at points that are supposedly \n'incorrect' for the condition, in the belief that they are inactive. The aim of \nthis study was to explore whether there is any difference in the effectiveness \nof auricular acupuncture at 'correct' and 'incorrect' points.\nMETHODS: Controlled trials of semi-permanent auricular acupuncture or \nacupressure for smoking cessation were systematically located, and the results \ncombined in exploratory meta-analyses which took into account the study quality.\nRESULTS: Thirteen studies were included. Combining ten studies showed auricular \nacupuncture at 'correct' points to be more effective than control interventions, \nodds ratio 2.24 (95% CI 1.61, 3.10), a result which is confirmed in the four \nhigh validity studies. Other analyses showed inconsistent results between all \nstudies and higher quality studies. Comparisons of three higher quality studies \nsuggest that 'correct' and 'incorrect' point acupuncture is no different (odds \nratio 1.22, CI 0.72, 2.07); and two studies showed that 'incorrect' point \nacupuncture may be more effective than other interventions (odds ratio 1.96, CI \n1.00, 3.86).\nCONCLUSION: Auricular acupuncture appears to be effective for smoking cessation, \nbut the effect may not depend on point location. This calls into question the \nsomatotopic model underlying auricular acupuncture and suggests a need to \nre-evaluate sham controlled studies which have used 'incorrect' points. Further \nexperiments are necessary to confirm or refute these observational conclusions.\n\nDOI: 10.1136\/aim.24.4.149\nPMID: 17264832 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

In placental mammals non-coding XIST RNA triggers silencing of one X (Xi) \nand recruits a characteristic suite of epigenetic modifications, including the \nhistone mark H3K27me3. In marsupials, where XIST is missing, H3K27me3 \nassociation seems to have different degrees of stability, depending on \ncell-types and species. However, the complete suite of histone marks associated \nwith the Xi and their stability throughout cell cycle remain a mystery, as does \nthe evolution of an ancient mammal XCI system. Our extensive immunofluorescence \nanalysis (using antibodies against specific histone modifications) in nuclei of \nmammals distantly related to human and mouse, revealed a general absence from \nthe mammalian Xi territory of transcription machinery and histone modifications \nassociated with active chromatin. Specific repressive modifications associated \nwith XCI in human and mouse were also observed in elephant (a distantly related \nplacental mammal), as was accumulation of XIST RNA. However, in two marsupial \nspecies the Xi either lacked these modifications (H4K20me1), or they were \nrestricted to specific windows of the cell cycle (H3K27me3, H3K9me2). \nSurprisingly, the marsupial Xi was stably enriched for modifications associated \nwith constitutive heterochromatin in all eukaryotes (H4K20me3, H3K9me3).

Peptide GV1001 is a peptide vaccine representing a \n16-amino acid human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence, which has been \nreported to possess potential antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory activity. \nThis study aimed to investigate the potential effects of peptide GV1001 on renal \nIRI.\nMETHODS: Peptide GV1001 was subcutaneously administered to C57BL6\/J mice 30 \nminutes before and 12 hours after bilateral IRI. Sham operation and \nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) injection were used as controls. Blood and renal \ntissues were harvested at 1 day after IRI.\nRESULTS: Peptide GV1001 treatment significantly attenuated renal functional \ndeterioration after IRI (peptide GV1001 group vs PBS group; blood urea nitrogen, \nP < .05; creatinine, P < .05). Peptide GV1001 treatment also attenuated renal \ntissue injury (tubular injury score; the peptide GV1001 group vs PBS group; P < \n.001). Renal apoptosis was also lower in the peptide GV1001 group. \nImmunohistochemical studies showed that IRI increased perirenal infiltration of \nboth neutrophils and macrophages, and that peptide GV1001 significantly \nattenuated this process. Expression of interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic \nprotein-1 was significantly reduced by peptide GV1001 treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Peptide GV1001 ameliorates acute renal IRI by reducing inflammation \nand apoptosis; therefore, it is promising as a potential therapeutic agent for \nrenal IRI. The mechanisms of protection should be explored in further studies.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The end point of this pathway is to induce \ntranscription, and to this end, there is a need to overcome a major obstacle, a \nset of inhibitors (I\u03baBs) that bind NF-\u03baB and prohibit either the nuclear entry \nor the DNA binding of the transcription factor. Two major signaling steps are \nrequired for the elimination of the inhibitors: activation of the I\u03baB kinase \n(IKK) and degradation of the phosphorylated inhibitors. IKK activation and I\u03baB \ndegradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediated by a \nspecific E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(\u03b2-TrCP) . The F-box component of this E3, \n\u03b2-TrCP, recognizes the I\u03baB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and \nthus couples I\u03baB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(\u03b2-TrCP) -mediated I\u03baB \nubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in \ncomplete degradation of the key inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 within a few minutes of cell \nstimulation. In vivo ablation of \u03b2-TrCP results in accumulation of all the I\u03baBs \nand complete NF-\u03baB inhibition. As many details of I\u03baB-\u03b2-TrCP interaction have \nbeen worked out, the development of \u03b2-TrCP inhibitors might be a feasible \ntherapeutic approach for NF-\u03baB-associated human disease. However, we may still \nneed to advance our understanding of the mechanism of I\u03baB degradation as well as \nof the diverse functions of \u03b2-TrCP in vivo.\n\n\u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons A\/S.\n\nDOI: 10.1111\/j.1600-065X.2012.01098.x\nPMID: 22435548 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Previously published work reported that melanoma cells exhibit \nconstitutive anti-apoptotic nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription \nfactor activation triggered by proteolysis of its inhibitor IkappaB. IkappaB \ndegradation is dependent upon its phosphorylation by the IkappaB kinase (IKK) \ncomplex and subsequent ubiquitination facilitated by beta-Trcp E3 ubiquitin \nligase. Here, we report that melanocytes expressing a conditionally oncogenic \nform of BRAF(V600E) exhibit enhanced beta-Trcp expression, increased IKK \nactivity and a concomitant increase in the rate of IkappaBalpha degradation. \nConversely, inhibition of BRAF signaling using either a broad-spectrum Raf \ninhibitor (BAY 43-9006) or by selective knock-down of BRAF(V600E) expression by \nRNA interference in human melanoma cells leads to decreased IKK activity and \nbeta-Trcp expression, stabilization of IkappaB, inhibition of NF-kappaB \ntranscriptional activity and sensitization of these cells to apoptosis. Taken \ntogether, these data support a model in which mutational activation of BRAF in \nhuman melanomas contributes to constitutive induction of NF-kappaB activity and \nto increased survival of melanoma cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1038\/sj.onc.1209994\nPMCID: PMC1903341\nPMID: 17001349 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

The MET receptor tyrosine \nkinase and its ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are implicated in tumor \ncell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in a broad spectrum of \nhuman cancers, including NSCLC. Amplification of MET has been reported in \napproximately 5%-22% of lung tumors with acquired resistance to small-molecule \ninhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Resistance to EGFR \ninhibitors is likely mediated through downstream activation of the \nphosphoinositide 3-kinase \/AKT pathway. Simultaneous treatment of resistant \ntumors with a MET inhibitor plus an EGFR inhibitor can abrogate activation of \ndownstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival, thereby \novercoming acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Development and preclinical \ntesting of multiple agents targeting the HGF-MET pathway, including monoclonal \nantibodies targeting HGF or the MET receptor and small-molecule inhibitors of \nthe MET tyrosine kinase, have confirmed the crucial role of this pathway in \nNSCLC. Several agents are now in phase III clinical development for the \ntreatment of NSCLC. This review summarizes the role of MET in the \npathophysiology of NSCLC and in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and \nprovides an update on progress in the clinical development of inhibitors of MET \nfor treatment of NSCLC.\n\nDOI: 10.1634\/theoncologist.2012-0262\nPMCID: PMC3579594\nPMID: 23345546 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest \nmay be found at the end of this article."]]}

All patients were \nunable to walk until 24 months of age, and still have a staggering gait, without \nmental retardation. They have also had choreoathetosis since early infancy. \nGenetic analysis of NKX2-1 revealed a novel missense mutation (p.Val205Phe) in \ntwo patients who were cousins and their maternal families, and a novel 2.6-Mb \ndeletion including NKX2-1 on chromosome 14 in the other patient. Congenital \nhypothyroidism was not detected on neonatal screening in the patient with the \nmissense mutation, and frequent respiratory infections were observed in the \npatient with the deletion in NKX2-1. Oral levodopa did not improve the gait \ndisturbance or involuntary movement. The results of (99m)Tc-ECD single-photon \nemission computed tomography (ECD-SPECT) analyzed using the easy Z-score imaging \nsystem showed decreased cerebral blood flow in the bilateral basal ganglia, \nespecially in the caudate nuclei, in all three patients, but no brain magnetic \nresonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities.

CNC is caused by inactivating \nmutations in the PRKAR1A gene encoding PKA type I alpha regulatory subunit \n(RI\u03b1). Although PKA activity is enhanced in CNC, the mechanisms linking PKA \ndysregulation to endocrine tumorigenesis are poorly understood. In this study, \nwe used F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors for cAMP and PKA \nactivity to define the role of RI\u03b1 in the spatiotemporal organization of the \ncAMP\/PKA pathway. RI\u03b1 knockdown in HEK293 cells increased basal as well as \nforskolin or prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)-stimulated total cellular PKA activity as \nreported by western blots of endogenous PKA targets and the FRET-based global \nPKA activity reporter, AKAR3. Using variants of AKAR3 targeted to subcellular \ncompartments, we identified similar increases in the response to PGE1 in the \ncytoplasm and at the outer mitochondrial membrane. In contrast, at the plasma \nmembrane, the response to PGE1 was decreased along with an increase in basal \nFRET ratio. These results were confirmed by western blot analysis of basal and \nPGE1-induced phosphorylation of membrane-associated vasodilator-stimulated \nphosphoprotein. Similar differences were observed between the cytoplasm and the \nplasma membrane in human adrenal cells carrying a RI\u03b1 inactivating mutation. RI\u03b1 \ninactivation also increased cAMP in the cytoplasm, at the outer mitochondrial \nmembrane and at the plasma membrane, as reported by targeted versions of the \ncAMP indicator Epac1-camps. These results show that RI\u03b1 inactivation leads to \nmultiple, compartment-specific alterations of the cAMP\/PKA pathway revealing new \naspects of signaling dysregulation in tumorigenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.1093\/hmg\/ddt510\nPMCID: PMC3919008\nPMID: 24122441 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Maintaining \ntelomeres is essential for sustaining the limitless replicative potential of \nsuch cancers. Because telomerase is thought to be active in all tumor cells and \nnormal stem cells, telomerase inhibition may be nonspecific and have detrimental \neffects on tissue maintenance and development by affecting normal stem cell \nself-renewal.\nMETHODS: We examined telomerase activity, telomere maintenance, and stem cell \nmaturation in tumor subpopulations from freshly resected gliomas, long-term, \nprimary, neural tumor-initiating cells (TIC) and corresponding normal stem cell \nlines. We then tested the efficacy of the telomerase inhibitor Imetelstat on \npropagation and self-renewal capacity of TIC and normal stem cells in vitro and \nin vivo.\nRESULTS: Telomerase was undetectable in the majority of tumor cells and specific \nto the TIC subpopulation that possessed critically short telomeres. In contrast, \nnormal tissue stem cells had longer telomeres and undetectable telomerase \nactivity and were insensitive to telomerase inhibition, which results in \nproliferation arrest, cell maturation, and DNA damage in neural TIC. Significant \nsurvival benefit and late tumor growth arrest of neuroblastoma TIC were observed \nin a xenograft model (P = 0.02). Furthermore, neural TIC exhibited irreversible \nloss of self-renewal and stem cell capabilities even after cessation of \ntreatment in vitro and in vivo.\nCONCLUSIONS: TIC exhaustion with telomerase inhibition and lack of telomerase \ndependency in normal stem cells add new dimensions to the telomere hypothesis \nand suggest that targeting TIC with telomerase inhibitors may represent a \nspecific and safe therapeutic approach for tumors of neural origin.\n\n\u00a92011 AACR.\n\nDOI: 10.1158\/1078-0432.CCR-10-2075\nPMID: 21208905 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

This therapeutic approach differentially \ntargets cancer cells that generally display rapid cell division compared to \nnormal tissue cells. However, although these treatments are initially effective \nin arresting tumor growth and reducing tumor burden, resistance and disease \nprogression eventually occur. A major mechanism underlying this resistance is \nincreased levels of cellular DNA repair. Most cells have complex mechanisms in \nplace to repair DNA damage that occurs due to environmental exposures or normal \nmetabolic processes. These systems, initially overwhelmed when faced with \nchemotherapy induced DNA damage, become more efficient under constant selective \npressure and as a result chemotherapies become less effective. Thus, inhibiting \nDNA repair pathways using target specific small molecule inhibitors may overcome \ncellular resistance to DNA damaging chemotherapies. Non-homologous end joining a \nmajor mechanism for the repair of double-strand breaks (DSB) in DNA is regulated \nin part by the serine\/threonine kinase, DNA dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). \nThe DNA-PK holoenzyme acts as a scaffold protein tethering broken DNA ends and \nrecruiting other repair molecules. It also has enzymatic activity that may be \ninvolved in DNA damage signaling. Because of its' central role in repair of \nDSBs, DNA-PK has been the focus of a number of small molecule studies. In these \nstudies specific DNA-PK inhibitors have shown efficacy in synergizing \nchemotherapies in vitro. However, compounds currently known to specifically \ninhibit DNA-PK are limited by poor pharmacokinetics: these compounds have poor \nsolubility and have high metabolic lability in vivo leading to short serum \nhalf-lives. Future improvement in DNA-PK inhibition will likely be achieved by \ndesigning new molecules based on the recently reported crystallographic \nstructure of DNA-PK.

Electronic address: Emma.Guttman@mountsinai.org.\n\nBACKGROUND: Severe atopic dermatitis (AD) has a high unmet need for effective \nand safe therapeutics. In early-phase trials, dupilumab, a fully human mAb \ntargeting IL-4 receptor \u03b1, markedly improved disease activity, but the effect of \nIL-4\/IL-13 blockade on AD at the molecular level has not been characterized.\nOBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate dupilumab modulation of the AD molecular \nsignature.\nMETHODS: We performed transcriptomic analyses of pretreatment and posttreatment \nskin biopsy specimens from patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated weekly \nwith 150 or 300 mg of dupilumab or placebo.\nRESULTS: Exacerbation of the AD transcriptome was observed in placebo-treated \npatients. Dupilumab improved the AD signature in a dose-dependent manner. \nExpression of genes upregulated in AD lesions decreased in patients treated with \ndupilumab by 26% (95% CI, 21% to 32%) and 65% (95% CI, 60% to 71%) for treatment \nwith 150 and 300 mg, respectively. Genes downregulated in AD lesions increased \nby 21% (95% CI, 16% to 27%) and 32% (95% CI, 26% to 37%) with dupilumab (150 and \n300 mg, respectively). The molecular changes paralleled improvements in clinical \nscores. A\u00a0dupilumab treatment signature of 821 probes (>2-fold change, P\u00a0< .05) \nsignificantly modulated in the 300-mg dupilumab group at week 4 compared with \nbaseline was identified in this sample set. Significant (P\u00a0< .05) decreases in \nmRNA expression of genes related to hyperplasia (K16 and MKI67), T cells, and \ndendritic cells (CD1b and CD1c) and potent inhibition of TH2-associated \nchemokines (CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, and CCL26) were noted without significant \nmodulation of TH1-associated genes (IFNG).\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing rapid improvement of the AD \nmolecular signature with targeted anti-IL-4 receptor \u03b1 therapy. These data \nsuggest that IL-4 and IL-13 drive a complex, TH2-centered inflammatory axis in \npatients with AD.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Since the previous update in 2004, a number of \nseminal observations regarding skin barrier and immune dysregulation in AD have \nbeen made with important therapeutic implications. A key addition to the \ntreatment algorithm based on our understanding that normal-appearing skin in \npatients with AD is not normal is proactive therapy. Studies with both topical \nsteroids and a topical calcineurin inhibitor have shown that in patients with \nrelapsing AD, if they are able to clear or almost clear their eczema, then \ntwice-weekly proactive treatment of normal-appearing skin that tends to flare \nleads to better disease control. For difficult-to-manage patients, the value of \nwet wrap therapy is reaffirmed in the practice parameter update. In addition, \nallergen immunotherapy is now a consideration in select patients with AD and \naeroallergen sensitivity. Beyond the practice parameter, novel approaches to \nfilaggrin deficiency are being evaluated. With respect to immune dysregulation, \ndupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed at the IL-4 receptor alpha \nsubunit was recently shown to be effective in treating adults with \nmoderate-to-severe AD.\n\nDOI: 10.2500\/aap.2014.35.3798\nPMID: 25584909 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for \nthe first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation \nof long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed \ntranscribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Interestingly, several \nhypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named 'hypoxia-induced noncoding \nultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical \nsamples from colon cancer patients. We show that these T-UCRs are predominantly \nnuclear and that the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is at least partly \nresponsible for the induction of several members of this group. One specific \nHINCUT, uc.475 (or HINCUT-1) is part of a retained intron of the host \nprotein-coding gene, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, which is \noverexpressed in epithelial cancer types. Consistent with the hypothesis that \nT-UCRs have important function in tumor formation, HINCUT-1 supports cell \nproliferation specifically under hypoxic conditions and may be critical for \noptimal O-GlcNAcylation of proteins when oxygen tension is limiting. Our data \ngives a first glimpse of a novel functional hypoxic network comprising \nprotein-coding transcripts and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) from the T-UCRs category.\n\nDOI: 10.1038\/cdd.2013.119\nPMCID: PMC3824588\nPMID: 24037088 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of \npalbociclib in combination with letrozole as first-line treatment of patients \nwith advanced, oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.\nMETHODS: In this open-label, randomised phase 2 study, postmenopausal women with \nadvanced oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer who had not \nreceived any systemic treatment for their advanced disease were eligible to \nparticipate. Patients were enrolled in two separate cohorts that accrued \nsequentially: in cohort 1, patients were enrolled on the basis of their \noestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative biomarker status alone, whereas in \ncohort 2 they were also required to have cancers with amplification of cyclin D1 \n(CCND1), loss of p16 (INK4A or CDKN2A), or both. In both cohorts, patients were \nrandomly assigned 1:1 via an interactive web-based randomisation system, \nstratified by disease site and disease-free interval, to receive continuous oral \nletrozole 2.5 mg daily or continuous oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily plus oral \npalbociclib 125 mg, given once daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off over \n28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free \nsurvival in the intention-to-treat population. Accrual to cohort 2 was stopped \nafter an unplanned interim analysis of cohort 1 and the statistical analysis \nplan for the primary endpoint was amended to a combined analysis of cohorts 1 \nand 2 (instead of cohort 2 alone). The study is ongoing but closed to accrual; \nthese are the results of the final analysis of progression-free survival. The \nstudy is registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00721409.\nFINDINGS: Between Dec 22, 2009, and May 12, 2012, we randomly assigned 165 \npatients, 84 to palbociclib plus letrozole and 81 to letrozole alone. At the \ntime of the final analysis for progression-free survival (median follow-up 29.6 \nmonths [95% CI 27.9-36.0] for the palbociclib plus letrozole group and 27.9 \nmonths [25.5-31.1] for the letrozole group), 41 progression-free survival events \nhad occurred in the palbociclib plus letrozole group and 59 in the letrozole \ngroup. Median progression-free survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 5.7-12.6) for \nthe letrozole group and 20.2 months (13.8-27.5) for the palbociclib plus \nletrozole group (HR 0.488, 95% CI 0.319-0.748; one-sided p=0.0004). In cohort 1 \n(n=66), median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (2.6-10.5) for the \nletrozole group and 26.1 months (11.2-not estimable) for the palbociclib plus \nletrozole group (HR 0.299, 0.156-0.572; one-sided p<0.0001); in cohort 2 (n=99), \nmedian progression-free survival was 11.1 months (7.1-16.4) for the letrozole \ngroup and 18.1 months (13.1-27.5) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR \n0.508, 0.303-0.853; one-sided p=0.0046). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was reported in \n45 (54%) of 83 patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole group versus one (1%) \nof 77 patients in the letrozole group, leucopenia in 16 (19%) versus none, and \nfatigue in four (4%) versus one (1%). Serious adverse events that occurred in \nmore than one patient in the palbociclib plus letrozole group were pulmonary \nembolism (three [4%] patients), back pain (two [2%]), and diarrhoea (two [2%]). \nNo cases of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia-related infections were reported \nduring the study. 11 (13%) patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole group and \ntwo (2%) in the letrozole group discontinued the study because of adverse \nevents.\nINTERPRETATION: The addition of palbociclib to letrozole in this phase 2 study \nsignificantly improved progression-free survival in women with advanced \noestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.

We investigated the relationship between \npendrin and deafness using mice that have (Slc26a4+\/+) or lack a complete \nSlc26a4 gene (Slc26a4-\/-).\nMETHODS: Expression of pendrin and other proteins was determined by confocal \nimmunocytochemistry. Expression of mRNA was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. \nThe endocochlear potential and the endolymphatic K+ concentration were measured \nwith double-barreled microelectrodes. Currents generated by the stria marginal \ncells were recorded with a vibrating probe. Tissue masses were evaluated by \nmorphometric distance measurements and pigmentation was quantified by \ndensitometry.\nRESULTS: Pendrin was found in the cochlea in apical membranes of spiral \nprominence cells and spindle-shaped cells of stria vascularis, in outer sulcus \nand root cells. Endolymph volume in Slc26a4-\/- mice was increased and tissue \nmasses in areas normally occupied by type I and II fibrocytes were reduced. \nSlc26a4-\/- mice lacked the endocochlear potential, which is generated across the \nbasal cell barrier by the K+ channel KCNJ10 localized in intermediate cells. \nStria vascularis was hyperpigmented, suggesting unalleviated free radical \ndamage. The basal cell barrier appeared intact; intermediate cells and KCNJ10 \nmRNA were present but KCNJ10 protein was absent. Endolymphatic K+ concentrations \nwere normal and membrane proteins necessary for K+ secretion were present, \nincluding the K+ channel KCNQ1 and KCNE1, Na+\/2Cl-\/K+ cotransporter SLC12A2 and \nthe gap junction GJB2.\nCONCLUSIONS: These observations demonstrate that pendrin dysfunction leads to a \nloss of KCNJ10 protein expression and a loss of the endocochlear potential, \nwhich may be the direct cause of deafness in Pendred syndrome.\n\nDOI: 10.1186\/1741-7015-2-30\nPMCID: PMC516044\nPMID: 15320950 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

These \nmedications interfere with the process of glucose reabsorption in the proximal \nconvoluted tubules in the kidneys, therefore increasing both glucose and water \ndiuresis. SGLT2 inhibitors were found to be effective in lowering HbA1c levels \nin double-blinded studies, both as monotherapy and in combination with other \noral hypoglycemic medications of various other mechanisms of action. SGLT2 \nInhibitors are not a risk factor for hypoglycemia and are suitable for \ncombination with insulin therapy. Their unique mode of action, relying on \nglomerular filtration, make these medication unsuitable for usage as treatment \nfor type 2 diabetes patients who are also suffering from moderate to severe \nrenal failure. Their main adverse effects are increased risk for urinary and \ngenital tract infections. The following review describes the relevant \npathophysiology addressed by these novel medications, evidence for efficacy and \nthe safety profile of SGLT2 Inhibitors.\n\nPMID: 25962253 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

The sodium-glucose \ncotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) mediates most of the glucose reabsorption from the \nproximal renal tubule. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glucosuria and provides a \nunique mechanism to lower elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes. The purpose \nof this review is to explore the physiology of SGLT2 and discuss several SGLT2 \ninhibitors which have clinical data in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS: We performed a PubMed search using the terms \"SGLT2\" and \"SGLT2 \ninhibitor\" through April 10, 2012. Published articles, press releases, and \nabstracts presented at national and international meetings were considered.\nRESULTS: SGLT2 inhibitors correct a novel pathophysiological defect, have an \ninsulin-independent action, are efficacious with glycosylated hemoglobin \nreduction ranging from 0.5% to 1.5%, promote weight loss, have a low incidence \nof hypoglycemia, complement the action of other antidiabetic agents, and can be \nused at any stage of diabetes. They are generally well tolerated. However, due \nto side effects, such as repeated urinary tract and genital infections, \nincreased hematocrit, and decreased blood pressure, appropriate patient \nselection for drug initiation and close monitoring after initiation will be \nimportant. Results of ongoing clinical studies of the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors \non diabetic complications and cardiovascular safety are crucial to determine the \nrisk-benefit ratio. A recent decision by the Committee for Medicinal Products \nfor Human Use of the European Medicines Agency has recommended approval of \ndapagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and \nexercise, in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products, \nincluding insulin, and as a monotherapy for metformin-intolerant patients. \nClinical research also remains to be carried out on the long-term effects of \nglucosuria and other potential effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, especially in view \nof the observed increase in the incidence of bladder and breast cancer. SGLT2 \ninhibitors represent a promising approach for the treatment of diabetes, and \ncould potentially be an addition to existing therapies.\n\nDOI: 10.2147\/DMSO.S22545\nPMCID: PMC3437808\nPMID: 22977310"]]}

Multiparameter flow \ncytometry (MPFC) was used to detect ES cells in bone marrow (BM) of ES patients \nat diagnosis and to evaluate the prognostic significance of CD56 expression in \nBM samples.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BM samples from 46 ES patients, 6 tumor aspirates, 2 ES \ncell lines, and 10 control BM samples were analyzed by MPFC. ES cells were \nidentified by the combination of CD45-\/CD90+\/CD99+. CD56 was evaluated on these \ncells by a cutoff of 22%.\nRESULTS: BM samples obtained from all patients at diagnosis were found to be \npositive for micrometastatic tumor cells assessed by CD99+\/CD90+\/CD45- \nexpression. A total of 60% of the BM samples harbored high CD56 expression. \nThere was a highly significant correlation between CD56 expression and \nprogression-free survival (PFS; 69% in low\/negative expression versus 30% in \nhigh expression groups, P = 0.024). In patients with localized nonpelvic \ndisease, those expressing low\/negative CD56 had 100% PFS versus 40% in the high \nexpressing group (P = 0.02). By Cox regression analysis, CD56 was found to be an \nindependent prognostic marker with an 11-fold increased risk for relapse in \npatients with localized disease (P = 0.006).\nCONCLUSION: All samples contained cells that are positive for the \nCD99+\/CD90+\/CD45- combination at diagnosis, indicating that ES is a systemic \ndisease.

Keck FT-ICR Mass Spectrometry Laboratory and Department of Chemistry, \nNorth Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC 27695, USA.\n\nA novel form of ovomacroglobulin\/ovostatin (OVOS2) predicted from EST data was \npreviously identified in the chicken ovarian cancer model using a mass \nspectrometry-based shotgun label-free proteomics strategy. The quantitative \nlabel-free data from plasma showed a significant increase over time with the \nspontaneous onset and progression of ovarian cancer making it a potential \nprotein biomarker for further study. Two other proteins of interest identified \nfrom this initial study included vitellogenin-1 (Vit-1), a lipid-transport \nprotein tied to egg production, and transthyretin (TTR), a retinol binding \ntransport protein currently used in the clinical management of ovarian cancer. A \nmultiplexed protein cleavage isotope dilution mass spectrometry (PC-IDMS) assay \nwas developed to quantify OVOS2, Vit-1, and TTR by selected reaction monitoring \n(SRM). A total of 6 stable isotope labeled (SIL) peptide standards were used in \nthe assay with three tryptic peptides from OVOS2, one for Vit-1, and two for \nTTR. The assay was developed for use with un-depleted raw plasma combined with \nthe filter assisted sample preparation (FASP) method and its use was also \ndemonstrated for matched ovary tissue samples. The PC-IDMS data for the two TTR \npeptides did not correlate with each other with more than a 10-fold difference \nin concentration for all 5 time points measured. The PC-IDMS data from the \nlongitudinal plasma samples correlated well for OVOS2 and Vit-1 whereas TTR was \ninconclusive. Interestingly, the absolute amount for one of the OVOS2 SIL \npeptides was 2-fold less compared with the other two SIL peptides. These data \nillustrate the successes and challenges of qualifying quantitative levels of \nproteins from an in-gel digestion sample preparation followed by LC-MS\/MS (GeLC) \nlabel-free discovery-based approach to a targeted SRM-based quantitative assay \nin plasma and tissues.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Markers such as serum creatinine, formulas to estimate glomerular \nfiltration rate, cystatin C, and proteinuria largely identify an underlying \ndisease process that is well established. Thus, there has been a recent effort \nto identify new biomarkers that reflect kidney function, early injury, and\/or \nrepair that ultimately can relate to progression or regression of damage. \nSeveral biomarkers emerged recently that are able to detect kidney damage \nearlier than is currently possible with traditional biomarkers such as serum \ncreatinine and proteinuria. Identification of urine biomarkers has proven to be \nbeneficial in recent years because of ease of handling, stability, and the \nability to standardize the various markers to creatinine or other peptides \ngenerally already present in the urine. Recent markers such as neutrophil \ngelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and \npodocin have garnered a lot of attention. The emergence of these and other \nbiomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic \napplications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney \ndisease.

KT is the best clinical treatment, however, the \nearly function of the allograft varies depending on multiple factors associated \nwith cold ischemia time (CIT) and the allograft rejection process. It is known \nthat serum creatinine is an insensitive and late marker for predicting graft \nrecovery after KT, mainly in patients with delayed graft function (DGF). \nNeutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is produced in the distal \nnephron and it is one of the most promising novel biomarkers for acute kidney \ninjury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). NGAL has been proposed to be a \npredictor of organ recovery from DGF after KT from donors after cardiac death. \nBecause nonrenal diseases can also induce NGAL, more information is necessary to \nvalidate the sensitivity and specificity of urine and plasma NGAL in clinical \nsamples. The exosomes are vesicles released into the urine from the kidney \nepithelium and they have been proposed as better source to explore as biomarker \nof renal dysfunction. The molecular composition of the urinary exosomes could be \nrepresentative of the physiological or physiopathologic condition of the urinary \nsystem. We propose that determination of NGAL in urinary exosomes is a better \npredictor of kidney dysfunction after KT than other urinary fractions. We \nanalyzed 15 kidney allograft recipients, with a mean age of 36 years (range, \n16-60 years) and 75% were male: 11 living donors (LD) and 4 deceased donors \n(DD). The average length of CIT was 14 hours in DD and less than 1 hour in LD. \nThree patient developed DGF. Using Western blot analysis, NGAL was detectable in \nthe cellular and exosomal fraction of the urine. The exosomes expressed higher \nlevels of NGAL than the cellular fraction. The expression of NGAL was observed \nfrom the first day after transplantation. In the cellular fraction of the urine, \nno significant differences of NGAL were observed between the patients. However, \nthe median of NGAL expression in the exosomes fraction was significantly higher \nin DD patient, from the first day after KT (P < .05). Moreover, we noticed that \nNGAL expression in exosomes remained elevated in the patients with DGF compared \nwith non-DGF patients (P < .05). Considering the highest abundance of NGAL in \nthe urinary exosomes and its correlation with DGF patients, we suggest the \nexosomal fraction as a more sensitive substrate to evaluate early biomarkers of \nDGF after KT.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Both endurance groups revealed higher \npain accompanied by higher accelerometer-based physical activity (PAL, CSP) than \nAR and FAR patients. Most of the subgroup differences displayed moderate to high \neffect sizes.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results indicate different pathways to chronic pain and \ndisability with physical underuse in FAR patients and overuse\/overload in \nendurance patients suggesting the need for individually targeted \ncognitive-behavioral treatments in the maladaptive groups. Implications for \nRehabilitation Improving the return to a normal physical activity level is an \nimportant goal for the rehabilitation of patients after lumbar disc surgery. \nDifferent pathways to chronic pain and disability with physical underuse in \nfear-avoidance patients and overuse in endurance patients should be considered. \nDifferent pain-related pain response pattern, based on the avoidance-endurance \nmodel, indicate the need for individual targeting of rehabilitation programs.\n\nDOI: 10.3109\/09638288.2013.814723\nPMID: 23865908 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Clinicians \nindicate that CLBP patients often show deconditioning but also CLBP patients who \nseem to be too active are seen. The objective of the present cross-sectional \nstudy was to gain more insight into the daily activity pattern of CLBP patients \ncompared to controls, using accelerometry.\nMETHODS: Daily activities were assessed by measuring body movement with a \ntri-axial accelerometer that was worn for seven consecutive days during waking \nhours. Measurements were performed in the daily environment (in-doors and \nout-doors) of the participant. Differences between activity level, time of day \nand work status were tested.\nRESULTS: Data were obtained from 29 CLBP patients and 20 controls. Results show \nthat the overall activity levels of patients (mean 0.75; SD 0.43) are not \nsignificantly different from those of controls (mean 0.71; SD 0.44). However, \npatients show significantly higher activity levels in the morning (p<0.001) and \nsignificantly lower activity levels in the evening (p<0.01) compared to \ncontrols. No significant differences in activity levels were found between \nleisure time and working days within either group; furthermore no significant \ndifferences in activity levels were found between patients with different work \nstatus.\nCONCLUSION: Overall activity levels do not differ significantly between CLBP \npatients and controls, but the distribution of activities over the day differs \nsignificantly.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.ejpain.2008.07.005\nPMID: 18752975 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

We\u00a0evaluated the addition of VPA to standard \nradiation therapy (RT) plus temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with newly diagnosed \nGBM.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-seven patients with newly diagnosed GBM were \nenrolled between July 2006 and April 2013. Patients received VPA, 25\u00a0mg\/kg \norally, divided into 2 daily doses concurrent with RT and TMZ. The first dose of \nVPA was given 1\u00a0week before the first day of RT at 10 to 15\u00a0mg\/kg\/day and \nsubsequently increased up to 25\u00a0mg\/kg\/day over the week prior to radiation. VPA- \nand TMZ-related acute toxicities were evaluated using Common Toxicity Criteria \nversion 3.0 (National Cancer Institute Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program) and \nCancer Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme for toxicity and adverse event \nreporting (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group\/European Organization for Research \nand Treatment).\nRESULTS: A total of 81% of patients took VPA according to protocol. Median \noverall survival (OS) was 29.6\u00a0months (range: 21-63.8\u00a0months), and median \nprogression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5\u00a0months (range: 6.8-51.2\u00a0months). OS at \n6, 12, and 24\u00a0months was 97%, 86%, and 56%, respectively. PFS at 6, 12, and \n24\u00a0months was 70%, 43%, and 38% respectively. The most common grade 3\/4 \ntoxicities of VPA in conjunction with RT\/TMZ therapy were blood and bone marrow \ntoxicity (32%), neurological toxicity (11%), and metabolic and laboratory \ntoxicity (8%). Younger\u00a0age and class V recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) \nresults were significant for both OS and PFS. VPA levels were not correlated \nwith grade 3 or 4 toxicity levels.\nCONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT\/TMZ in patients with newly \ndiagnosed GBM was well tolerated. Additionally, VPA may result in improved \noutcomes compared to historical data and merits further study.\n\nPublished by Elsevier Inc.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.ijrobp.2015.04.038\nPMCID: PMC4510472\nPMID: 26194676 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Conflict of interest: none."],["1.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation of cancer \ncells with stem cell properties found in GBMs, have been shown to be extremely \nresistant to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents and have the ability to \nreadily reform tumors. Therefore, the development of therapeutic agents \ntargeting CSCs is extremely important. In this study, we isolated \nglioblastoma-derived stem cells (GDSCs) from GBM tissue removed from patients \nduring surgery and analyzed their gene expression using quantitative real-time \nPCR and immunocytochemistry. We examined the effects of histone deacetylase \ninhibitors trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA) on the proliferation and \ngene expression profiles of GDSCs. The GDSCs expressed significantly higher \nlevels of both neural and embryonic stem cell markers compared to GBM cells \nexpanded in conventional monolayer cultures. Treatment of GDSCs with histone \ndeacetylase inhibitors, TSA and VPA, significantly reduced proliferation rates \nof the cells and expression of the stem cell markers, indicating differentiation \nof the cells. Since differentiation into GBM makes them susceptible to the \nconventional cancer treatments, we posit that use of histone deacetylase \ninhibitors may increase efficacy of the conventional cancer treatments for \neliminating GDSCs.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s12031-014-0329-0\nPMID: 24874578 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

We demonstrate that lysosomal \ndegradation of the HIF-1\u03b1 subunit by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a \nmajor regulator of HIF-1 activity. Pharmacological inhibitors of lysosomal \ndegradation, such as bafilomycin and chloroquine, increased HIF-1\u03b1 levels and \nHIF-1 activity, whereas activators of chaperone-mediated autophagy, including \n6-aminonicotinamide and nutrient starvation, decreased HIF-1\u03b1 levels and HIF-1 \nactivity. In contrast, macroautophagy inhibitors did not increase HIF-1 \nactivity. Transcription factor EB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, \nalso negatively regulated HIF-1 activity. HIF-1\u03b1 interacts with HSC70 and \nLAMP2A, which are core components of the CMA machinery. Overexpression of HSC70 \nor LAMP2A decreased HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels, whereas knockdown had the opposite \neffect. Finally, hypoxia increased the transcription of genes involved in CMA \nand lysosomal biogenesis in cancer cells. Thus, pharmacological and genetic \napproaches identify CMA as a major regulator of HIF-1 activity and identify \ninterplay between autophagy and the response to hypoxia.\n\nDOI: 10.1074\/jbc.M112.414771\nPMCID: PMC3624450\nPMID: 23457305 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

The expanding \ncommercial scale production and use of ceria nanoparticles have inevitably \nincreased the risk of release of nanoceria into the environment as well as the \nrisk of human exposure. The use of nanoceria in biomedical applications is also \nbeing currently investigated because of its recently characterized antioxidative \nproperties. In this study, we investigated the impact of ceria nanoparticles on \nthe lysosome-autophagy system, the main catabolic pathway that is activated in \nmammalian cells upon internalization of exogenous material. We tested a battery \nof ceria nanoparticles functionalized with different types of biocompatible \ncoatings (N-acetylglucosamine, polyethylene glycol and polyvinylpyrrolidone) \nexpected to have minimal effect on lysosomal integrity and function. We found \nthat ceria nanoparticles promote activation of the transcription factor EB, a \nmaster regulator of lysosomal function and autophagy, and induce upregulation of \ngenes of the lysosome-autophagy system. We further show that the array of \ndifferently functionalized ceria nanoparticles tested in this study enhance \nautophagic clearance of proteolipid aggregates that accumulate as a result of \ninefficient function of the lysosome-autophagy system. This study provides a \nmechanistic understanding of the interaction of ceria nanoparticles with the \nlysosome-autophagy system and demonstrates that ceria nanoparticles are \nactivators of autophagy and promote clearance of autophagic cargo. These results \nprovide insights for the use of nanoceria in biomedical applications, including \ndrug delivery. These findings will also inform the design of engineered \nnanoparticles with safe and precisely controlled impact on the environment and \nthe design of nanotherapeutics for the treatment of diseases with defective \nautophagic function and accumulation of lysosomal storage material.\n\nDOI: 10.1021\/nn505073u\nPMID: 25315655 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

In \nvitro studies involving a wall-membrane particulate fraction of Bacillus \nmegaterium KM demonstrated that mersacidin did not prevent the synthesis of \nlipid II [undecaprenyl-diphosphoryl-N-acetylmuramoyl-(pentapeptide)-N-ac ety \nlglucosamine] but specifically the subsequent conversion of this intermediate \ninto polymeric nascent glycan strands by transglycosylation. Comparison with \nother inhibitors of transglycosylation shows that the effective concentration of \nmersacidin in vitro is in the range of that of the glycopeptide antibiotic \nvancomycin but 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the competitive \nenzyme inhibitor moenomycin. The analogy to the glycopeptides may hint at an \ninteraction of mersacidin with the peptidoglycan precursor rather than with the \nenzyme. Unlike vancomycin however, mersacidin inhibits peptidoglycan formation \nfrom UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide and is active against Enterococcus faecium \nexpressing the vanA resistance gene cluster. This indicates that the molecular \ntarget site of mersacidin differs from that of vancomycin and that no \ncross-resistance exists between the two antibiotics.\n\nDOI: 10.1111\/j.1432-1033.1997.t01-1-00193.x\nPMID: 9210483 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

In \nthe current study, we evaluated gefitinib, a potent EGFR inhibitor, in the \ntreatment of adults with newly diagnosed GBM.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: Ninety-eight patients (96 evaluable) were accrued between \nMay 18, 2001, and August 2, 2002. All were newly diagnosed GBM patients who were \nclinically and radiographically stable\/improved after radiation treatment \n(enrollment within 5 weeks of radiation completion). No prior chemotherapy was \npermitted. EGFR amplification\/mutation, as assessed by fluorescence in situ \nhybridization and immunohistochemistry, was not required for treatment with \ngefitinib but was studied when tissues were available. Gefitinib was \nadministered at 500 mg each day; for patients receiving dexamethasone or \nenzyme-inducing (CYP3A4) agents, dose was escalated to a maximum of 1,000 mg QD. \nTreatment cycles were repeated at 4-week intervals with brain magnetic resonance \nimaging at 8-week intervals.\nRESULTS: Overall survival (OS; calculated from time of initial surgery) at 1 \nyear (primary end point) with gefitinib was 54.2%, which was not statistically \ndifferent compared with that of historical control population (48.9%, data from \nthree previous Phase III North Central Cancer Treatment Group studies of newly \ndiagnosed GBM patients). Progression-free survival (PFS) at 1 year post-RT \n(16.7%) was also not significantly different to that of historical controls \n(30.3%). Clinical outcome was not affected by EGFR status (amplification or vIII \nmutation). Fatigue (41%), rash (62%), and loose stools (58%) constituted the \nmost frequent adverse events, the majority of these being limited to Grade 1\/2. \nOf note, the occurrence of drug-related adverse effects, such as loose stools \nwas associated with improved OS.\nCONCLUSIONS: In our evaluation of nearly 100 patients with newly diagnosed GBM, \ntreatment with adjuvant gefitinib post-radiation was not associated with \nsignificant improvement in OS or PFS. However, patients who experienced \ngefitinib-associated adverse effects (rash\/diarrhea) did demonstrate improved \nOS.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We examined whether personality traits \nare associated with such resilience to clinical dementia in individuals with AD \nneuropathology. Broad factors and specific facets of personality were assessed \nup to 28 years (mean 11 \u00b1 7 years) before onset of dementia and up to 30 years \n(mean 15 \u00b1 7 years) before death in a cohort (n = 111) evaluated for AD \nneuropathology at autopsy. Individuals with higher baseline scores on \nvulnerability to stress, anxiety, and depression (neuroticism: odds ratio, 2.0; \n95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.5), or lower scores on order and competence \n(conscientiousness: odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.9) were less \nlikely to remain asymptomatic in the presence of AD neuropathology. Neuroticism \n(r = 0.26), low agreeableness (r = -0.34), and some facets were also \nsignificantly associated with advanced stages of neurofibrillary tangles, but \nthe associations between personality traits and risk of clinical dementia were \nmostly unchanged by controlling for the extent of neurofibrillary tangles and A\u03b2 \nneuritic plaques.

The \naim of the current study was to explore the separate and combined effects of \nneuroticism and extraversion on the risk of dementia, and to examine whether \nlifestyle factors may modify this association.\nMETHODS: A population-based cohort of 506 older people with no dementia from the \nKungsholmen Project, Stockholm, Sweden, was followed up for an average of 6 \nyears. Personality traits were assessed using the Eysenck Personality Inventory. \nDementia was diagnosed by specialists according to DSM-III-R criteria.\nRESULTS: Neither high neuroticism nor low extraversion alone was related to \nsignificantly higher incidence of dementia. However, among people with an \ninactive or socially isolated lifestyle, low neuroticism was associated with a \ndecreased dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] \n= 0.27-0.96). When compared to persons with high neuroticism and high \nextraversion, a decreased risk of dementia was detected in individuals with low \nneuroticism and high extraversion (HR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.28-0.94), but not among \npersons with low neuroticism and low extraversion (HR = 0.95, 95% CI = \n0.57-1.60), nor high neuroticism and low extraversion (HR = 0.97 95% CI = \n0.57-1.65). Stratified analysis by lifestyle showed that the inverse association \nof low neuroticism and high extraversion in combination was present only among \nthe inactive or socially isolated persons.\nCONCLUSION: Low neuroticism in combination with high extraversion is the \npersonality trait associated with the lowest dementia risk; however, among \nsocially isolated individuals even low neuroticism alone seems to decrease \ndementia risk.\n\nDOI: 10.1212\/01.wnl.0000339485.39246.87\nPMID: 19153372 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Previously we identified thousands of \ncis-regulated expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across multiple tissues \nusing a panel of rat recombinant inbred (RI) strains derived from Brown Norway \nand SHR progenitors. These cis-eQTLs represent potential susceptibility loci \nunderlying physiological and pathophysiological traits manifested in SHR. We \nhave prioritized 60 cis-eQTLs and confirmed differential expression between the \nparental strains by quantitative PCR in 43 (72%) of the eQTL transcripts. \nQuantitative trait transcript (QTT) analysis in the RI strains showed highly \nsignificant correlation between cis-eQTL transcript abundance and clinically \nrelevant traits such as systolic blood pressure and blood glucose, with the \nphysical location of a subset of the cis-eQTLs colocalizing with \"physiological\" \nQTLs (pQTLs) for these same traits. These colocalizing correlated cis-eQTLs \n(c3-eQTLs) are highly attractive as primary susceptibility loci for the \ncolocalizing pQTLs. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the c3-eQTL genes \nidentified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are predicted to affect \ntranscription factor binding affinity, splicing and protein function. These \nSNPs, which potentially alter transcript abundance and stability, represent \nstrong candidate factors underlying not just eQTL expression phenotypes, but \nalso the correlated metabolic and physiological traits. In conclusion, by \nintegration of genomic sequence, eQTL and QTT datasets we have identified \nseveral genes that are strong positional candidates for pathophysiological \ntraits observed in the SHR strain. These findings provide a basis for the \nfunctional testing and ultimate elucidation of the molecular basis of these \nmetabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes.\n\nDOI: 10.1152\/physiolgenomics.00210.2010\nPMCID: PMC3217321\nPMID: 21846806 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

The regulation of transcription involves the concerted \naction of multiple transcription factors (TFs) and cohesin's role in this \ncontext of combinatorial TF binding remains unexplored. To investigate \ncohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as \nwell as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional \nregulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. We observe a positive \ncorrelation between the number of distinct TFs bound and the presence of CNC \nsites. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, \nCNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers \nand are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. We also \nshow that cohesin presence partially explains the commonly observed discrepancy \nbetween TF motif score and ChIP signal. Evidence from these statistical analyses \nin wild-type cells, and comparisons to maps of TF binding in Rad21-cohesin \nhaploinsufficient mouse liver, suggests that cohesin helps to stabilize large \nprotein-DNA complexes. Finally, we observe that the presence of mirrored CTCF \nbinding events at promoters and their nearby cohesin-bound enhancers is \nassociated with elevated expression levels.\n\nDOI: 10.1101\/gr.136507.111\nPMCID: PMC3483546\nPMID: 22780989 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Here, we show by ChIP-Seq that most human subtelomeres contain \na CTCF- and cohesin-binding site within \u223c1-2\u2009kb of the TTAGGG repeat tract and \nadjacent to a CpG-islands implicated in TERRA transcription control. ChIP-Seq \nalso revealed that RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) was enriched at sites adjacent to \nthe CTCF sites and extending towards the telomere repeat tracts. Mutation of \nCTCF-binding sites in plasmid-borne promoters reduced transcriptional activity \nin an orientation-dependent manner. Depletion of CTCF by shRNA led to a decrease \nin TERRA transcription, and a loss of cohesin and RNAPII binding to the \nsubtelomeres. Depletion of either CTCF or cohesin subunit Rad21 caused \ntelomere-induced DNA damage foci (TIF) formation, and destabilized TRF1 and TRF2 \nbinding to the TTAGGG proximal subtelomere DNA. These findings indicate that \nCTCF and cohesin are integral components of most human subtelomeres, and \nimportant for the regulation of TERRA transcription and telomere end protection.\n\nDOI: 10.1038\/emboj.2012.266\nPMCID: PMC3492729\nPMID: 23010778 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declare that they have no conflict \nof interest."]]}

Here we report the \nidentification of new fluorescent protein fragments derived from Venus and \nCerulean for BiFC and multicolor BiFC assays under physiological culture \nconditions. More importantly, the newly identified combinations exhibit a \n13-fold higher BiFC efficiency than originally identified fragments derived from \nYFP. Furthermore, the use of new combinations reduces the amount of plasmid \nrequired for transfection and shortens the incubation time, leading to a 2-fold \nincrease in specific BiFC signals. These newly identified fluorescent protein \nfragments will facilitate the study of protein-protein interactions in living \ncells and whole animals under physiological conditions.\n\nDOI: 10.2144\/000112036\nPMID: 16454041 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

The majority of these methods either require disruption of \nthe cells to detect molecular interactions or rely on indirect detection of the \nprotein interaction. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay \nprovides a direct approach for the visualization of molecular interactions in \nliving cells and organisms. The BiFC approach is based on the facilitated \nassociation between two fragments of a fluorescent protein when the fragments \nare brought together by an interaction between proteins fused to the fragments. \nThe BiFC approach has been used for visualization of interactions among a \nvariety of structurally diverse interaction partners in many different cell \ntypes. It enables detection of transient complexes as well as complexes formed \nby a subpopulation of the interaction partners. It is essential to include \nnegative controls in each experiment in which the interface between the \ninteraction partners has been mutated or deleted. The BiFC assay has been \nadapted for simultaneous visualization of multiple protein complexes in the same \ncell and the competition for shared interaction partners. A ubiquitin-mediated \nfluorescence complementation assay has also been developed for visualization of \nthe covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin family peptides. These \nfluorescence complementation assays have a great potential to illuminate a \nvariety of biological interactions in the future.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/S0091-679X(08)85019-4\nPMCID: PMC2829325\nPMID: 18155474 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

At present, however, genetic testing of CREBBP is not commonly \napplied in clinical settings because the currently available assays are \ntechnically and financially demanding, mainly because of the size of the gene. \nIn the present study, we took advantage of a highly sensitive and specific, \nautomated denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) technique. \nFirst, we developed a DHPLC-based protocol to analyze the entire coding region \nof CREBBP. Second, we analyzed genetic samples from 21 RSTS patients using \nDHPLC.

In this \nmanner, all the exons were simultaneously amplified using a single block in a \nPCR machine.

UMV4, unlike most other (non-fungal) viruses, does not spread to \nuninfected cells by release into the extracellular milieu during its normal life \ncycle and is thus dependent upon host survival for replication. In symbiosis \nwith the host fungus, UMV4 encodes KP4 to kill other competitive strains of U. \nmaydis, thereby promoting both host and virus survival. KP4 belongs to a family \nof fungal toxins and determining its structure should lead to a better \nunderstanding of the function and evolutionary origins of these toxins. \nElucidation of the mechanism of toxin action could lead to new anti-fungal \nagents against human pathogens.\nRESULTS: We have determined the atomic structure of KP4 to 1.9 A resolution. KP4 \nbelongs to the alpha\/beta-sandwich family, and has a unique topology comprising \na five-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet with two antiparallel alpha-helices \nlying at approximately 45 degrees to these strands. The structure has two \nleft-handed beta alpha beta cross-overs and a basic protuberance extending from \nthe beta-sheet. In vivo experiments demonstrated abrogation of toxin killing by \nCa2+ and, to a lesser extent, Mg2+. These results led to experiments \ndemonstrating that the toxin specifically inhibits voltage-gated Ca2+ channels \nin mammalian cells.\nCONCLUSIONS: Similarities, although somewhat limited, between KP4 and scorpion \ntoxins led us to investigate the possibility that the toxic effects of KP4 may \nbe mediated by inhibition of cation channels. Our results suggest that certain \nproperties of fungal Ca2+ channels are homologous to those in mammalian cells. \nKP4 may, therefore, be a new tool for studying mammalian Ca2+ channels and \ncurrent mammalian Ca2+ channel inhibitors may be useful lead compounds for new \nanti-fungal agents.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/s0969-2126(01)00215-5\nPMID: 7582897 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Previous studies demonstrated that this toxin inhibits growth \nof the target fungal cells by blocking calcium uptake rather than forming \nchannels, as had been suggested previously. Unexpectedly, this toxin was also \nshown to inhibit voltage-gated calcium channel activity in mammalian cells. We \nused whole-cell patch-clamp techniques to further characterize this activity \nagainst mammalian cells. KP4 is shown to specifically block L-type calcium \nchannels with weak voltage dependence to the block. Because KP4 activity is \nabrogated by calcium, KP4 probably binds competitively with calcium to the \nchannel exterior. Finally, it is shown that chemical reagents that modify lysine \nresidues reduce KP4 activity in both patch-clamp experiments on mammalian cells \nand in fungal killing assays. Because the only lysine residue is K42, this \nresidue seems to be crucial for both mammalian and fungal channel activity. Our \nresults defining the type of mammalian channel affected by this fungal toxin \nfurther support our contention that KP4 inhibits fungal growth by blocking \ntransmembrane calcium flux through fungal calcium channels, and imply a high \ndegree of structural homology between these fungal and mammalian calcium \nchannels.\n\nDOI: 10.1124\/mol.61.4.936\nPMID: 11901234 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Surprisingly, Aire did not \ncontrol MSC suppression of T cell proliferation in vitro. Instead, Aire reduced \nT cell mitochondrial reductase by negatively regulating a proinflammatory \ncytokine, early T cell activation factor (Eta)-1.

Large \nFUS-immunoreactive inclusions fill the perikaryon of surviving motor neurons of \nALS patients carrying mutations at post-mortem.

Fus is not required for APC-RNP \nlocalization but is required for efficient translation of associated \ntranscripts.

Instead, APC-RNP \ntranscripts are translated within cytoplasmic Fus granules. These results \nunexpectedly show that translation can occur within stress-like granules. \nImportantly, they identify a new local function for cytoplasmic Fus with \nimplications for ALS pathology.\n\nDOI: 10.1083\/jcb.201306058\nPMCID: PMC3857475\nPMID: 24297750 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

By \ncontrast, zebrafish are able to resolve the scar and to regenerate functional \ncardiac muscle. It is not known how opposing cellular responses of fibrosis and \nnew myocardium formation are spatially and temporally coordinated during heart \nregeneration in zebrafish. Here, we report that the balance between the \nreparative and regenerative processes is achieved through Smad3-dependent TGF\u03b2 \nsignaling. The type I receptor alk5b (tgfbr1b) is expressed in both fibrotic and \ncardiac cells of the injured heart. TGF\u03b2 ligands are locally induced following \ncryoinjury and activate the signaling pathway both in the infarct area and in \ncardiomyocytes in the vicinity of the trauma zone. Inhibition of the relevant \ntype I receptors with the specific chemical inhibitor SB431542 qualitatively \naltered the infarct tissue and completely abolished heart regeneration. We show \nthat transient scar formation is an essential step to maintain robustness of the \ndamaged ventricular wall prior to cardiomyocyte replacement. Taking advantage of \nthe reversible action of the inhibitor, we dissected the multifunctional role of \nTGF\u03b2 signaling into three crucial processes: collagen-rich scar deposition, \nTenascin C-associated tissue remodeling at the infarct-myocardium interface, and \ncardiomyocyte proliferation. Thus, TGF\u03b2 signaling orchestrates the beneficial \ninterplay between scar-based repair and cardiomyocyte-based regeneration to \nachieve complete heart regeneration.\n\nDOI: 10.1242\/dev.078543\nPMID: 22513374 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Among all endogenic factors, biological \nsub-factors are the significant predictors of happiness. Existence of \nsignificant differences in temperament and happiness of infants is an indicator \nof biological influences. Therefore, this study aimed to consider biological \nfactors that underlie happiness. At the first, all of the biological factors in \nrelation with happiness were searched from following websites: PubMed, Wiley& \nSons, Science direct (1990-2014). Then, the articles divided into five \nsub-groups (genetic, brain and neurotransmitters, endocrinology and hormones, \nphysical health, morphology and physical attractiveness). Finally, a systematic \nreview performed based on existing information. Results of studies on genetic \nfactors indicated an average effectiveness of genetic about 35 -50 percent on \nhappiness. In spite of difficulties in finding special genes, several genes \ndistributed to emotion and mood. Neuroscience studies showed that some part of \nbrain (e.g. amygdala, hipocamp and limbic system) and neurotransmitters (e.g. \ndopamine, serotonin, norepinefrine and endorphin) play a role in control of \nhappiness. A few studies pointed to the role of cortisol and adrenaline (adrenal \ngland) and oxitocin (pituitary gland) in controlling happiness. Physical health \nand typology also concluded in most related studies to have a significant role \nin happiness. Therefore, according to previous research, it can be said that \nbiological and health factors are critical in underlying happiness and its role \nin happiness is undeniable.\n\nPMCID: PMC4449495\nPMID: 26060713"],["1.

Mamede do Coronado, Portugal.\n\nPURPOSE: Opicapone (OPC) is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) \ninhibitor to be used as adjunctive therapy in levodopa-treated patients with \nParkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of \nmoderate liver impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD; \neffect on COMT activity) of OPC.\nMETHODS: An open-label, parallel-group study in patients (n\u2009=\u20098) with moderate \nliver impairment (Child-Pugh category B, score of 7 to 9) and matched healthy \nsubjects (n\u2009=\u20098, control) with normal liver function. All subjects received a \nsingle 50-mg oral dose of OPC, with plasma and urine concentrations of opicapone \nand its metabolites measured up to 72\u00a0h post-dose, including soluble COMT \n(S-COMT) activity. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare \nthe main PK and PD parameters between groups. Point estimates (PE) of geometric \nmean ratios (GMR) and corresponding 90\u00a0% confidence intervals (90%CI) for the \nratio hepatic\/control subjects of each parameter were calculated and compared \nwith the reference interval (80-125\u00a0%).\nRESULTS: Exposure to opicapone (AUC and Cmax) increased significantly in \npatients with moderate hepatic impairment (PE [90%CI]: AUC0-\u221e, 184\u00a0% \n[135-250\u00a0%]; Cmax, 189\u00a0% [144-249\u00a0%]). Although apparent total clearance (CL\/F) \nof opicapone was decreased by \u223c35\u00a0%, similar elimination half-life and \nunbound\/bound fractions of opicapone were observed between the two groups. Both \nrate and extent of exposure to BIA 9-1103 were higher in the hepatically \nimpaired group, but not statistically significant compared with the control \ngroup. Similar to the parent (opicapone), the observed increase in exposure to \nBIA 9-1106 was statistically significant in the hepatically impaired group over \nthe control group. BIA 9-1106 was the only metabolite detected in urine and its \nurine PK parameters were in accordance with plasma data. Maximum S-COMT \ninhibition (Emax) occurred earlier for the hepatically impaired group with \nvalues of 100\u00a0% and 91.2\u00a0% for the hepatically impaired and control groups \nrespectively. Both Emax and AUEC for the hepatically impaired group reached \nstatistical significance over the control group. OPC was well tolerated in both \nhepatically impaired and control groups.\nCONCLUSION: The bioavailability of an orally administered single dose of 50\u00a0mg \nOPC was significantly higher in patients with moderate chronic hepatic \nimpairment, perhaps by a reduced first-pass effect. As the tolerability profile \nof OPC was favourable under the conditions of this study and its exposure is \ncompletely purged from systemic circulation before the subsequent dose \nadministration, no OPC dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to \nmoderate chronic hepatic impairment. However, as OPC is under clinical \ndevelopment for use as adjunctive therapy in levodopa-treated patients with \nParkinson's disease, an adjustment of levodopa and\/or OPC regimens in patients \nshould be carefully considered based on a potentially enhanced levodopa \ndopaminergic response and the associated tolerability.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00228-013-1602-9\nPMID: 24271646 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Its systemic exposure increased in an \napproximately dose-proportional manner with an apparent terminal half-life of \n1.0 to 1.4\u2009h. Sulphation was the main metabolic pathway. Opicapone metabolites \nrecovered in urine accounted for less than 3% of the amount of opicapone \nadministered suggesting that bile is likely the main route of excretion. Maximum \nS-COMT inhibition (Emax ) ranged from 69.9% to 98.0% following the last dose of \nopicapone. The opicapone-induced S-COMT inhibition showed a half-life in excess \nof 100\u2009h, which was dose-independent and much longer than plasma drug exposure. \nSuch a half-life translates into a putative underlying rate constant that is \ncomparable with the estimated dissociation rate constant of the COMT-opicapone \ncomplex.\nCONCLUSION: Despite its short elimination half-life, opicapone markedly and \nsustainably inhibited erythrocyte S-COMT activity making it suitable for a once \ndaily regimen.\n\n\u00a9 2013 BIAL - Portela and C\u00aa S.A.

The biomedical importance \nof these enzymes is highlighted by the many lysosomal storage disorders that are \nassociated with mutations in genes encoding lysosomal proteins, and there is \nalso evidence that lysosomal activities may be involved in more widespread human \ndiseases. The aim of this study was to characterize the human brain lysosomal \nproteome with the goal of establishing a reference map to investigate human \ndiseases of unknown etiology and to gain insights into the cellular function of \nthe lysosome. Proteins containing mannose 6-phosphate (Man6-P), a carbohydrate \nmodification used for targeting resident soluble lysosomal proteins to the \nlysosome, were affinity-purified using immobilized Man6-P receptor. \nFractionation by two-dimensional electrophoresis resolved a complex mixture \ncomprising approximately 800 spots. Constituent proteins in each spot were \nidentified using a combination of matrix-assisted laser \ndesorption\/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (both peptide mass \nfingerprinting and tandem mass spectrometry) [corrected] on in-gel tryptic \ndigests and N-terminal sequencing. In a complementary analysis, we also analyzed \na tryptic digest of the unfractionated mixture by liquid chromatography MS\/MS. \nIn total, 61 different proteins were identified. Seven were likely contaminants \nassociated with true Man6-P glycoproteins. Forty-one were known lysosomal \nproteins of which 11 have not previously been reported to contain Man6-P. An \nadditional nine proteins were either uncharacterized or proteins not previously \nreported to have lysosomal function. We found that the human brain \nMan6-P-containing lysosomal proteome is highly complex and contains more \nproteins with a much greater number of individual isoforms than found in \nprevious studies of Man6-P glycoproteomes.\n\nDOI: 10.1002\/pmic.200401054\nPMID: 15789345 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

However, lysosomal proteins are also present in \nhuman plasma, and a proportion of these retain mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P), a \nmodification on N-linked glycans that is recognized by Man-6-P receptors (MPRs) \nthat normally direct the targeting of these proteins to the lysosome. In this \nstudy, we purified the Man-6-P glycoforms of proteins from human plasma by \naffinity chromatography on immobilized MPRs and characterized this subproteome \nby two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by tandem mass spectrometry. As \nexpected, we identified many known and potential candidate lysosomal proteins. \nIn addition, we also identified a number of abundant classical plasma proteins \nthat were retained even after two consecutive rounds of affinity purification. \nGiven their abundance in plasma, we initially considered these proteins to be \nlikely contaminants, but a mass spectrometric study of Man-6-phosphorylation \nsites using MPR-purified glycopeptides revealed that some proportion of these \nclassical plasma proteins contained the Man-6-P modification. We propose that \nthese glycoproteins are phosphorylated at low levels by the lysosomal enzyme \nphosphotransferase, but their high abundance results in detection of Man-6-P \nglycoforms in plasma. These results may provide useful insights into the \nmolecular processes underlying Man-6-phosphorylation and highlight circumstances \nunder which the presence of Man-6-P may not be indicative of lysosomal function. \nIn addition, characterization of the plasma Man-6-P glycoproteome should \nfacilitate development of mass spectrometry-based tools for the diagnosis of \nlysosomal storage diseases and for investigating the involvement of \nMan-6-P-containing glycoproteins in more widespread human diseases and their \npotential utility as biomarkers.\n\nDOI: 10.1074\/mcp.M600030-MCP200\nPMID: 16709564 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Most cases of Ewing's sarcoma express the EWS\/FLI fusion protein. \nEWS\/FLI functions as an aberrant ETS-type transcription factor and serves as the \nmaster regulator of Ewing's sarcoma-transformed phenotype. We recently showed \nthat EWS\/FLI regulates one of its key targets, NR0B1, through a \nGGAA-microsatellite in its promoter. Whether other critical EWS\/FLI targets are \nalso regulated by GGAA-microsatellites was unknown. In this study, we combined \ntranscriptional analysis, whole genome localization data, and RNA interference \nknockdown to identify glutathione S-transferase M4 (GSTM4) as a critical EWS\/FLI \ntarget gene in Ewing's sarcoma. We found that EWS\/FLI directly binds the GSTM4 \npromoter, and regulates GSTM4 expression through a GGAA-microsatellite in its \npromoter. Reduction of GSTM4 levels caused a loss of oncogenic transformation. \nFurthermore, reduction of GSTM4 resulted in an increased sensitivity of Ewing's \nsarcoma cells to chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting a role for this protein in \ndrug resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, patients with Ewing's sarcoma \nwhose tumors had higher levels of GSTM4 expression had worse outcomes than those \nwith lower expression levels. These data show that GSTM4 contributes to the \ncancerous behavior of Ewing's sarcoma and define a wider role for \nGGAA-microsatellites in EWS\/FLI function than previously appreciated. These data \nalso suggest a novel therapeutic resistance mechanism, in which the central \noncogenic abnormality directly regulates a resistance gene.\n\nDOI: 10.1038\/onc.2009.262\nPMID: 19718047 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Although extensive efforts have \nbeen exerted on this issue, the locations of replication origins still remain \nelusive 7 years after the publication of its complete genome sequence in 1996. \nAmbiguous results were obtained in identifying the replication origins of M. \njannaschii based on all theoretical and experimental approaches. In the genome \nof M. jannaschii, we found that an ORF (MJ0774), annotated as a hypothetical \nprotein, is a homologue of the Cdc6 protein. The position of the gene is at a \nglobal minimum of the x component of the Z curve, i.e., RY disparity curve, \nwhich has been used to identify replication origins in other Archaea. In \naddition, an intergenic region (694,540-695,226 bp) that is between the cdc6 \ngene and an adjacent ORF shows almost all the characteristics of known \nreplication origins, i.e., it is highly rich in AT composition (80%) and \ncontains multiple copies of repeat elements and AT stretches. Therefore, these \nlines of evidence strongly suggest that the identified region is a replication \norigin, which is designated as oriC1. The analysis of the y component of the Z \ncurve, i.e., MK disparity curve, suggests the presence of another replication \norigin corresponding to one of the peaks in the MK disparity curve at around \n1,388 kb of the genome.\n\nCopyright 2004 Springer-Verlag\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00792-004-0385-4\nPMID: 15197606 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Mutations in TRPV4, encoding a cation \nchannel, have recently been identified in one large dominant congenital spinal \nmuscular atrophy kindred, but the genetic basis of dominant congenital spinal \nmuscular atrophy in many families remains unknown. It has been hypothesized that \ndifferences in the timing and site of anterior horn cell loss in the central \nnervous system account for the variations in clinical phenotype between \ndifferent forms of spinal muscular atrophy, but there has been a lack of \nneuropathological data to support this concept in dominant congenital spinal \nmuscular atrophy. We report clinical, electrophysiology, muscle magnetic \nresonance imaging and histopathology findings in a four generation family with \ntypical dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy features, without mutations \nin TRPV4, and in whom linkage to other known dominant neuropathy and spinal \nmuscular atrophy genes has been excluded. The autopsy findings in the proband, \nwho died at 14 months of age from an unrelated illness, provided a rare \nopportunity to study the neuropathological basis of dominant congenital spinal \nmuscular atrophy. There was a reduction in anterior horn cell number in the \nlumbar and, to a lesser degree, the cervical spinal cord, and atrophy of the \nventral nerve roots at these levels, in the absence of additional peripheral \nnerve pathology or abnormalities elsewhere along the neuraxis. Despite the young \nage of the child at the time of autopsy, there was no pathological evidence of \nongoing loss or degeneration of anterior horn cells suggesting that anterior \nhorn cell loss in dominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy occurs in early \nlife, and is largely complete by the end of infancy. These findings confirm that \ndominant congenital spinal muscular atrophy is a true form of spinal muscular \natrophy caused by a loss of anterior horn cells localized to lumbar and cervical \nregions early in development.\n\nDOI: 10.1093\/brain\/aws108\nPMID: 22628388 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

This reorganization is accompanied by changing \npatterns of calcium signaling in neurons and glial cells. In the present study, \nwe investigated the developmental distribution of a major calcium-dependent \nprotein, viz., calcium\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), \nin the antennal lobe of the sphinx moth Manduca sexta by using a monoclonal \nantibody. During synaptogenesis (developmental stages 6-10), we found a \nredistribution of CaM kinase II immunoreactivity, from a homogeneous \ndistribution in the immature neuropil to an accumulation in the neuropil of the \nglomeruli. CaM kinase II immunoreactivity was less intense in olfactory receptor \naxons of the antennal nerve and antennal lobe glial cells. Western blot analysis \nrevealed a growing content of CaM kinase II in antennal lobe tissue throughout \nmetamorphosis. Injection of the CaM kinase inhibitor KN-93 into pupae resulted \nin a reduced number of antennal lobe glial cells migrating into the neuropil to \nform borders around glomeruli. The results suggest that CaM kinase II is \ninvolved in glial cell migration.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00441-006-0249-6\nPMID: 16896952 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Previously, we identified >90 different \nsplice variants of Chk2, a gene encoding a serine\/threonine kinase propagating \nthe DNA damage signal by phosphorylating and activating several downstream \nsubstrates like p53, Cdc25A, and Cdc25C involved in cell cycle arrest and \napoptosis. While alternative splice forms of other genes have been reported to \nexert a dominant-negative effect on the wild-type molecules, the function of \nChk2 splice protein variants is still unclear. Here we evaluated the function of \nfour Chk2 splice proteins for which mRNA splice variants were identified in \nhuman breast carcinomas. These splice variants were stably expressed as nuclear \nproteins. Two splice forms (Chk2Delta4 and Chk2del(2-3)) expressed kinase \nactivity while variants Chk2Delta11 and Chk2isoI were essentially kinase \ninactive. Independent of intrinsic kinase activity, each splice variant impaired \nwild-type Chk2 activity through heterodimerization.

We analysed clinical and genetic data from \npatients in the INC to determine the distribution of CMT subtypes and the \nclinical impairment associated with them.\nMETHODS: We analysed data from 1652 patients evaluated at 13 INC centres. The \ndistribution of CMT subtypes and pathogenic genetic mutations were determined. \nThe disease burden of all the mutations was assessed by the CMT Neuropathy Score \n(CMTNS) and CMT Examination Score (CMTES).\nRESULTS: 997 of the 1652 patients (60.4%) received a genetic diagnosis. The most \ncommon CMT subtypes were CMT1A\/PMP22 duplication, CMT1X\/GJB1 mutation, \nCMT2A\/MFN2 mutation, CMT1B\/MPZ mutation, and hereditary neuropathy with \nliability to pressure palsy\/PMP22 deletion. These five subtypes of CMT accounted \nfor 89.2% of all genetically confirmed mutations. Mean CMTNS for some but not \nall subtypes were similar to those previously reported.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that large numbers of patients with a \nrepresentative variety of CMT subtypes have been enrolled and that the frequency \nof achieving a molecular diagnosis and distribution of the CMT subtypes reflects \nthose previously reported. Measures of severity are similar, though not \nidentical, to results from smaller series. This study confirms that it is \npossible to assess patients in a uniform way between international centres, \nwhich is critical for the planned natural history study and future clinical \ntrials. These data will provide a representative baseline for longitudinal \nstudies of CMT.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ID number NCT01193075.\n\nPublished by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Some \npublications shed light to the role of other viruses in this disease as well. \nOur molecular investigation has demonstrated that adeno- and herpes viruses \nmight also frequently occur in dilated cardiomyopathy.\nAIM: The aim of our study was to screen virus genomes in heart tissues from \nheart-transplanted patients to prove their possible role in the pathogenesis of \ndilated cardiomyopathy.\nMETHODS: DNA and RNA were isolated from five regions of the heart muscle. \nAmplification for Adenovirus Type 3, Human Herpes Virus Type 6 and Enterovirus \ngenomes were performed by nested-Polymerase Chain Reaction.

M. Verboon-Maciolek@umcutrecht.nl\n\nBACKGROUND: Enteroviruses (EV) are an important cause of neonatal disease \nincluding hepatitis, meningoencephalitis, and myocarditis that can lead to death \nor severe long-term sequelae. Less is known about severe neonatal infection \ncaused by the parechoviruses (PeV) of which type 1 (PeV1) and type 2 (PeV2) were \npreviously known as echovirus 22 and echovirus 23. They belong to the same \nfamily of Picornaviridae as the EV. Of the PeV, so far only PeV3 has been \nassociated in 2 recent reports with severe neonatal infection including \ninvolvement of central nervous system.\nMETHODS: We compared the clinical signs, diagnosis, laboratory data, cerebral \nimaging, and neurodevelopmental outcome of 11 neonates with PeV infection with \n21 infants with EV infection treated in our hospital between 1994 and 2006. The \ndiagnosis of EV infection or PeV infection was confirmed by a positive EV and\/or \nPeV real time-polymerase chain reaction on blood, cerebrospinal fluid, (CSF) or \nstool or a viral culture of stool, nasopharyngeal swab, and\/or CSF.\nRESULTS: The 32 infants presented with sepsis-like illness and the most frequent \nsigns were: fever, seizures, irritability, rash, and feeding problems. All \npatients received antibiotic treatment. Eleven of 21 infants infected with EV \nand 7 of 11 infants infected with PeV were full-term. Differentiation between \nthe infants infected with EV and PeV on the basis of fever, irritability, rash, \nand seizures was not possible. Myocarditis was exclusively seen in 4 patients \ninfected by EV. Eight of 11 patients with a PeV infection had \nmeningoencephalitis of whom only 1 infant developed pleocytosis in the CSF. \nSerum C-reactive protein and CSF protein values were significantly higher in \ninfants with EV infection than in those with PeV infection. Cerebral imaging of \nall infants with EV or PeV cerebral infection showed mild to severe white matter \nabnormalities. In 1 infant with EV infection and 3 infants with PeV infection, \nneurodevelopmental delay occurred. Mortality and long-term sequelae were mainly \nassociated with myocarditis in the infants who were infected with EV (4 of 21).\nCONCLUSIONS: It is not possible to distinguish neonatal PeV from EV infection on \nthe basis of clinical signs. Neonates with PeV or EV infection present with \nsepsis-like illness and the most frequent signs are fever, seizures, \nirritability, rash, and feeding problems.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/INF.0b013e31815c1b07\nPMID: 18277927 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

These genes encode for the \nproteins KRIT1\/CCM1 (krev interaction trapped 1\/cerebral cavernous malformations \n1), cerebral cavernous malformations 2, osmosensing scaffold for MEKK3 \n(CCM2\/malcavernin\/OSM), and cerebral cavernous malformations 3\/programmed cell \ndeath 10 (CCM3\/PDCD10). There have been many significant recent advances in our \nunderstanding of the structure and function of these proteins, as well as in \ntheir roles in cellular signaling. Here, we provide an update on the current \nknowledge of the structure of the CCM proteins and their functions within \ncellular signaling, particularly in cellular adhesion complexes and signaling \ncascades. We go on to discuss subcellular localization of the CCM proteins, the \nformation and regulation of the CCM complex signaling platform, and current \nprogress towards targeted therapy for CCM disease. Recent structural studies \nhave begun to shed new light on CCM protein function, and we focus here on how \nthese studies have helped inform the current understanding of these roles and \nhow they may aid future studies into both CCM-related biology and disease \nmechanisms.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00018-013-1532-9\nPMCID: PMC3999170\nPMID: 24287896 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

MCT8 deficiency causes severe psychomotor retardation and \nabnormal thyroid tests. The great majority of affected children cannot walk or \ntalk, and all have elevated serum T(3) levels, causing peripheral tissue \nhypermetabolism and inability to maintain weight. Treatment with thyroid hormone \nis ineffective. In Mct8-deficient mice, the thyroid hormone analog, \ndiiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA), does not require MCT8 to enter tissues and \ncould be an effective alternative to thyroid hormone treatment in humans.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect and efficacy of \nDITPA in children with MCT8 deficiency.\nMETHODS: This was a multicenter report of four affected children given DITPA on \ncompassionate grounds for 26-40 months. Treatment was initiated at ages 8.5-25 \nmonths, beginning with a small dose of 1.8 mg, increasing to a maximal 30 mg\/d \n(2.1-2.4 mg\/kg \u00b7 d), given in three divided doses.\nRESULTS: DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached \n1 mg\/kg \u00b7 d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The \nfollowing significant changes were also observed: decline in SHBG (in all \nsubjects), heart rate (in three of four), and ferritin (in one of four). \nCholesterol increased in two subjects. There was no weight loss and weight gain \noccurred in two. None of the treated children required a gastric feeding tube or \ndeveloped seizures. No adverse effects were observed.\nCONCLUSION: DITPA (1-2 mg\/kg \u00b7 d) almost completely normalizes thyroid tests and \nreduces the hypermetabolism and the tendency for weight loss. The effects of \nearlier commencement and long-term therapy remain to be determined.\n\nDOI: 10.1210\/jc.2012-2556\nPMCID: PMC3513545\nPMID: 22993035 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

We have moved from a situation of only having two choices, \ninsulin and sulfonylureas, to a position of myriad choices from 11 categories of \nmedications (insulin, sulfonylureas, biguanides, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, \ngliptins (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [DPP IV] inhibitors), bromocriptine, \nglucagon-like peptide analogues, thiazolidinediones, glinides, amylin analogues \nand bile acid sequestrants. One of the most recent additions to this list are \nthe DPP IV inhibitors commonly known as gliptins. Currently, there are four DPP \nIV inhibitors available in various countries-alogliptin, sitagliptin, \nvildagliptin and saxagliptin (1). Of these, two have been approved for clinical \nuse in the United States: sitagliptin and saxagliptin. Additionally, \nlinagliptin, vildagliptin and alogliptin are currently in phase III development \nin the United States while studies with another DPP IV inhibitor, dutogliptin, \nhave been terminated (2). Alogliptin was approved for use in Japan under the \ntrade name Nesina\u00ae in April 2010 (3). This manuscript will review alogliptin, \nits chemistry, pharmacokinetics\/pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, clinical \ntrials and its current state of FDA review. Preclinical animal data have been \nreviewed elsewhere and will not be outlined in this manuscript.

Aim of the present meta-analysis is the systematic \ncollection and synthesis of information on treatment-emergent cases of acute \nheart failure described in randomized clinical trials with DPP4.\nDATA SOURCES: An extensive Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Database search for \n\"vildagliptin\", \"sitagliptin\", \"saxagliptin\", \"alogliptin\", \"linagliptin\", and \n\"dutogliptin\" was performed, collecting all randomized clinical trials on humans \nup to October 1st, 2013. Studies were included if they satisfied the following \ncriteria: i) randomized trials, ii) duration \u226524 weeks; iii) on type 2 diabetes; \niv) comparison of DPP4i with placebo or active drugs. The principal outcome was \nthe effect of DPP4i on the incidence of acute heart failure. A total of 84 \neligible trials was identified. The overall risk of acute heart failure was \nhigher in patients treated with DPP4i in comparison with those treated with \nplacebo\/active comparators (MH-OR: 1.19[1.03; 1.37]; p = 0.015). When trials \nwith non-cardiovascular outcomes were analysed separately no signal of risk was \ndetectable.\nCONCLUSION: Available data from RCTs suggest that DPP4i could be associated with \nan increased risk of heart failure, without any clear evidence of differences \namong drugs of the class. Although it is plausible that the risk is greater in \nsome sub-populations of patients, current evidence is not yet sufficient to \nidentify susceptible patients.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We found that 55.3% of cases belonged to mutated and 44.7% to \nunmutated CLL, progressive disease predominating in the unmutated subset. IGHV \ngene use resembled that obtained for Mediterranean countries, except for \nunderrepresentation of the IGHV4 subgroup in our cohort.\nBACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) results from the clonal expansion \nof mature B lymphocytes and is characterized by extreme clinical heterogeneity. \nOne of the most reliable prognostic markers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia \n(CLL) is the mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes, \nwhich defines 2 subsets, mutated CLL (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL), with \ndifferent clinical courses. Biased IGHV gene use between M-CLL and U-CLL clones, \nas well as population differences in the IGHV gene repertoire have been \nreported.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, mutational status and configuration of \nIGHV-IGHD-IGHJ rearrangements in 85 Serbian patients were analyzed using reverse \ntranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing methodology.\nRESULTS: We found that 55.3% of cases belonged to M-CLL and 44.7% belonged to \nU-CLL, with progressive disease predominating in the unmutated subset. Most \nfrequently expressed was the IGHV3 subgroup (55.7%), followed by IGHV1 (27.3%), \nIGHV4 (12.5%), IGHV5 (2.3%), IGHV2 (1.1%), and IGHV6 (1.1%). The distribution of \nIGHD subgroups was as follows: IGHD3, 39.1%; IGHD2, 21.8%; IGHD6, 12.6%; IGHD1, \n10.3%; IGHD4, 8%; IGHD5, 6.9%; and IGHD7, 1.1%. The most frequent IGHJ gene was \nIGHJ4 (48.9%), followed by IGHJ6 (28.4%), IGHJ3 (11.4%), and IGHJ5 (11.4%). In \n15.3% of cases, heavy complementarity-determining region 3 (VH CDR3) amino acid \nsequences could be assigned to previously defined stereotyped clusters.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study showed a strong correlation between IGHV gene mutational \nstatus and clinical course of CLL.

However, molecular \nsignature of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their prognostic value in \nbreast cancer patients remain elusive. We hypothesized that a distinct network \nof immune function genes at the tumor site can predict a low risk versus high \nrisk of distant relapse in breast cancer patients regardless of the status of \nER, PR, or HER-2\/neu in their tumors. We conducted retrospective studies in a \ndiverse cohort of breast cancer patients with a 1-5\u00a0year tumor relapse versus \nthose with up to 7\u00a0years relapse-free survival. The RNAs were extracted from the \nfrozen tumor specimens at the time of diagnosis and subjected to microarray \nanalysis and real-time RT-PCR. Paraffin-embedded tissues were also subjected to \nimmunohistochemistry staining. We determined that a network of immune function \ngenes involved in B cell development, interferon signaling associated with \nallograft rejection and autoimmune reaction, antigen presentation pathway, and \ncross talk between adaptive and innate immune responses were exclusively \nupregulated in patients with relapse-free survival. Among the 299 genes, five \ngenes which included B cell response genes were found to predict with >85% \naccuracy relapse-free survival. Real-time RT-PCR confirmed the 5-gene prognostic \nsignature that was distinct from an FDA-cleared 70-gene signature of MammaPrint \npanel and from the Oncotype DX recurrence score assay panel. These data suggest \nthat neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with high risk of relapse may reduce \ntumor recurrence by inducing the immune function genes.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s10549-011-1470-x\nPMCID: PMC3431022\nPMID: 21479927 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Patients \nwith systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have an increased risk of developing \nendothelial dysfunction and premature cardiovascular disease. Neutrophil \nextracellular trap (NET) formation is increased in SLE and has been proposed to \ncontribute to endothelial damage, but the mechanism remains unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the mechanism by which enhanced NET formation by \nlow-density granulocytes (LDGs) in SLE contributes to endothelial damage and \ndisrupts the endothelium.\nRESULTS: The putative role of NET-externalised matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) \nin altering the functional integrity of the endothelium was examined.

Endothelial dysfunction correlated with the activation of endothelial \nMMP-2 by MMP-9 present in NETs, while inhibition of MMP-2 activation restored \nendothelium-dependent function and decreased NET-induced vascular cytotoxicity. \nMoreover, immunogenic complexes composed of MMP-9 and anti-MMP-9 were identified \nin SLE sera. These complexes, as well as anti-MMP-9 autoantibodies, induced \nNETosis and enhanced MMP-9 activity.\nCONCLUSIONS: These observations implicate activation of endothelial MMP-2 by \nMMP-9 contained in NETs as an important player in endothelial dysfunction, and \nMMP-9 as a novel self-antigen in SLE. These results further support that \naberrant NET formation plays pathogenic roles in SLE.\n\nPublished by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In the fruit fly, simple feeding with spermidine inhibited loss of \nclimbing activity and early organismal death upon heterologous expression of \nhuman \u03b1-synuclein, which is thought to be the principal toxic trigger of PD. In \nthis line, administration of spermidine rescued \u03b1-synuclein-induced loss of \ndopaminergic neurons, a hallmark of PD, in nematodes. Alleviation of PD-related \nneurodegeneration by spermidine was accompanied by induction of autophagy, \nsuggesting that this cytoprotective process may be responsible for the \nbeneficial effects of spermidine administration.\n\nDOI: 10.4161\/15384101.2014.973309\nPMCID: PMC4614020\nPMID: 25483063 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

The \naggregation rate of \u03b1-Syn is accelerated in the presence of physiological levels \nof cellular polyamines. Here we applied single molecule AFM force spectroscopy \nto characterize the effect of spermidine on the very first stages of \u03b1-Syn \naggregation--misfolding and assembly into dimers. Two \u03b1-Syn variants, the \nwild-type (WT) protein and A30P, were studied. The two protein molecules were \ncovalently immobilized at the C-terminus, one at the AFM tip and the other on \nthe substrate, and intermolecular interactions between the two molecules were \nmeasured by multiple approach-retraction cycles. At conditions close to \nphysiological ones at which \u03b1-Syn misfolding is a rare event, the addition of \nspermidine leads to a dramatic increase in the propensity of the WT and mutant \nproteins to misfold. Importantly, misfolding is characterized by a set of \nconformations, and A30P changes the misfolding pattern as well as the strength \nof the intermolecular interactions. Together with the fact that spermidine \nfacilitates late stages of \u03b1-Syn aggregation, our data demonstrate that \nspermidine promotes the very early stages of protein aggregation including \u03b1-Syn \nmisfolding and dimerization. This finding suggests that increased levels of \nspermidine and potentially other polyamines can initiate the disease-related \nprocess of \u03b1-Syn.\n\nDOI: 10.1371\/journal.pone.0038099\nPMCID: PMC3360652\nPMID: 22662273 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have declared \nthat no competing interests exist."]]}

Over \n300 ECM molecules have been defined as comprising the \"core matrisome\" in \nmammals through the analysis of whole genome sequences. During tooth \ndevelopment, the structure and functions of the ECM dynamically change. In the \nearly stages, basement membranes (BMs) separate two cell layers of the dental \nepithelium and the mesenchyme. Later in the differentiation stages, the BM layer \nis replaced with the enamel matrix and the dentin matrix, which are secreted by \nameloblasts and odontoblasts, respectively. The enamel matrix genes and the \ndentin matrix genes are each clustered in two closed regions located on human \nchromosome 4 (mouse chromosome 5), except for the gene coded for amelogenin, the \nmajor enamel matrix protein, which is located on the sex chromosomes. These \ngenes for enamel and dentin matrix proteins are derived from a common ancestral \ngene, but as a result of evolution, they diverged in terms of their specific \nfunctions. These matrix proteins play important roles in cell adhesion, \npolarity, and differentiation and mineralization of enamel and dentin matrices. \nMutations of these genes cause diseases such as odontogenesis imperfect (OI) and \namelogenesis imperfect (AI).

Glaser, G.H. Thomas, E.S. Siegfried, S.C.R. Elgin, and J.T. \nLis, J. Mol. Biol. 211:751-761, 1990). This (CT)n element appears to contribute \nto formation of the wild-type chromatin structure of hsp26, an organized \nnucleosome array that leaves the HSEs in nucleosome-free, DNase I-hypersensitive \n(DH) sites (Q. Lu, L.L. Wallrath, B.D. Allan, R.L. Glaser, J.T. Lis, and S.C.R. \nElgin, J. Mol. Biol. 225:985-998, 1992). Inspection of the sequences upstream of \nhsp26 has revealed an additional (CT)n element at -347 to -341, adjacent to the \ndistal HSE. We have analyzed the contribution of this distal (CT)n element (-347 \nto -341), the proximal (CT)n element (-135 to -85), and the two HSEs both to the \nformation of the chromatin structure and to heat shock inducibility. hsp26 \nconstructs containing site-directed mutations, deletions, substitutions, or \nrearrangements of these sequence elements have been fused in frame to the \nEscherichia coli lacZ gene and reintroduced into the D. melanogaster genome by \nP-element-mediated germ line transformation. Chromatin structure of the \ntransgenes was analyzed (prior to gene activation) by DNase I or restriction \nenzyme treatment of isolated nuclei, and heat-inducible expression was monitored \nby measuring beta-galactosidase activity. The results indicate that mutations, \ndeletions, or substitutions of either the distal or the proximal (CT)n element \naffect the chromatin structure and heat-inducible expression of the transgenes. \nThese (CT)n repeats are associated with a nonhistone protein(s) in vivo and are \nbound by a purified Drosophila protein, the GAGA factor, in vitro. In contrast, \nthe HSEs are required for heat-inducible expression but play only a minor role \nin establishing the chromatin structure of the transgenes. Previous analysis \nindicates that prior to heat shock, these HSEs appear to be free of protein. Our \nresults suggest that GAGA factor, an abundant protein factor required for normal \nexpression of many Drosophila genes, and heat shock factor, a specific \ntranscription factor activated upon heat shock, play distinct roles in gene \nregulation: the GAGA factor establishes and\/or maintains the DH sites prior to \nheat shock induction, while the activated heat shock factor recognizes and binds \nHSEs located within the DH sites to trigger transcription.\n\nDOI: 10.1128\/mcb.13.5.2802-2814.1993\nPMCID: PMC359663\nPMID: 8474442 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Mutations in either gene cause global demethylation. In \nthis work we have assessed the effects of these mutations on the PAI tryptophan \nbiosynthetic gene family, which consists of four densely methylated genes \narranged as a tail-to-tail inverted repeat plus two unlinked singlet genes. The \nmethylation mutations caused only partial demethylation of the PAI loci: ddm1 \nhad a strong effect on the singlet genes but a weaker effect on the inverted \nrepeat, whereas met1 had a stronger effect on the inverted repeat than on the \nsinglet genes. The double ddm1 met1 mutant also displayed partial demethylation \nof the PAI genes, with a pattern similar to the ddm1 single mutant. To determine \nthe relationship between partial methylation and expression for the singlet PAI2 \ngene we constructed a novel reporter strain of Arabidopsis in which PAI2 \nsilencing could be monitored by a blue fluorescent plant phenotype diagnostic of \ntryptophan pathway defects. This reporter strain revealed that intermediate \nlevels of methylation correlate with intermediate suppression of the fluorescent \nphenotype.\n\nDOI: 10.1093\/nar\/29.10.2127\nPMCID: PMC55449\nPMID: 11353082 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

This variant phenotype is associated with a \nreduction in the level of global DNA methylation. To explore possible \nrelationships between DNA methylation level and accumulation of DNA-(cytosine-5) \nmethyltransferase (DNMT) transcripts, the full-length coding sequences \ncorresponding to three different DNMT families in oil palm, namely the MET, CMT, \nand DRM classes, have been isolated and characterized. The corresponding genes \nwere designated as EgMET1, EgCMT1, and EgDRM1, and encode predicted polypeptides \nof 1543, 925, and 591 amino acid residues, respectively. Expression of oil palm \nDNMTs was compared between normal and variant calli and inflorescence tissues \nusing quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. A consistent increase in \ntranscript levels of EgMET1 and EgCMT1 was found in variant fast-growing calli \nrelative to nodular-compact calli. Nodular-compact calli give rise to about 5% \nof abnormal regenerants whereas fast-growing calli generate 95% of 'mantled' \npalms in their clonal offspring and were previously demonstrated as having \nmarkedly hypomethylated DNA. In immature abnormal inflorescences only EgMET1 \ntranscript levels were increased, while no changes in relative abundance of the \nEgCMT1 or EgDRM1 transcripts were observed. Therefore, the genome-wide \nhypomethylation previously described in 'mantled' material cannot be explained \nby a decrease in expression levels of the de novo or maintenance DNMTs, a \nparadox which has been previously reported in tumour cells, where there is \nevidence for global hypomethylation of DNA.\n\nDOI: 10.1093\/jxb\/ern178\nPMID: 18640997 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Many well characterized \nmarkers of embryonic stem cells including CD9, PODXL and centromere-specific \nhistone-H3-like protein CENPA are consistently expressed in TGCTs. In embryonic \nstem cells, pluripotency and self renewal capacities are provided by a network \nof OCT3\/4, NANOG and SOX2. In testicular germ cell tumors, pluripotency genes \nOCT3\/4 und NANOG are upregulated both, in seminomas and non-seminomas, while \nSOX2 is differentially upregulated in embryonal carcinomas only. Similar to \nembryonic stem cells, most histological elements of type II GCTs are sensitive \nto chemotherapy and irradiation. Furthermore, all invasive TGCTs show a \nconsistent gain of the short arm of chromosome 12, as found in ES cells upon \nextensive in vitro culturing. Moreover, the genetic constitution of testicular \ngerm cell tumors can also be linked to characteristics of embryonic stem cells, \nlikely related to their specific inability to repair DNA damage and their high \nsensitivity to apoptotic cell death.

CENPA chromatin is \nepigenetically propagated on unique and different centromere DNA sequences in a \npathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Formation of neocentromeres on DNA, \nnonhomologous to native centromeres, indicates a role of non-DNA sequence \ndeterminants in CENPA deposition. Neocentromeres have been shown to form at \nmultiple loci in C. albicans when a native centromere was deleted. However, the \nprocess of site selection for CENPA deposition on native or neocentromeres in \nthe absence of defined DNA sequences remains elusive. By systematic deletion of \nCENPA chromatin-containing regions of variable length of different chromosomes, \nfollowed by mapping of neocentromere loci in C. albicans and its related species \nCandida dubliniensis, which share similar centromere properties, we demonstrate \nthat the chromosomal location is an evolutionarily conserved primary determinant \nof CENPA deposition. Neocentromeres on the altered chromosome are always formed \nclose to the site which was once occupied by the native centromere. \nInterestingly, repositioning of CENPA chromatin from the neocentromere to the \nnative centromere occurs by gene conversion in C. albicans.\n\nDOI: 10.1101\/gr.141614.112\nPMCID: PMC3613581\nPMID: 23439889 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

CHD7 is \na chromodomain-containing, ATP dependent helicase protein that is highly \nexpressed in the developing ear and is required for semicircular canal \ndevelopment in both humans and mice. Here we report that mice with heterozygous \nloss of Chd7 function exhibit delayed semicircular canal genesis, delayed \nNetrin1 expression and disrupted expression of genes that are critical for \nsemicircular canal formation (Bmp2, Bmp4, Msx1 and Fgf10). Complete loss of Chd7 \nresults in aplasia of the semicircular canals and sensory vestibular organs, \nwith reduced or absent expression of Otx1, Hmx3, Jagged1, Lmo4, Msx1 and Sox2. \nOur results suggest that Chd7 may have critical selector gene functions during \ninner ear morphogenesis. Detailed analysis of the epigenetic modifications \nunderlying these gene expression changes should provide insights into \nsemicircular canal development and help in the design of therapies for \nindividuals with inner ear malformations.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Homologous recombination \n(HR) repair is a critical pathway of repairing DNA double strand breaks, and it \nplays an essential role in maintaining genomic integrity. Previous studies have \nshown that BRIT1, also known as MCPH1, is a key regulator of HR repair. Here, we \nreport that chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4) is a novel BRIT1 \nbinding partner that regulates the HR repair process. The BRCA1 C-terminal \ndomains of BRIT1 are required for its interaction with CHD4. Depletion of CHD4 \nand overexpression of the ATPase-dead form of CHD4 impairs the recruitment of \nBRIT1 to the DNA damage lesions. As a functional consequence, CHD4 deficiency \nsensitizes cells to double strand break-inducing agents, reduces the recruitment \nof HR repair factor BRCA1, and impairs HR repair efficiency. We further \ndemonstrate that CHD4-depleted cells are more sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) \npolymerase inhibitor treatment. In response to DNA damage induced by \npoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, CHD4 deficiency impairs the recruitment \nof DNA repair proteins BRIT1, BRCA1, and replication protein A at early steps of \nHR repair. Taken together, our findings identify an important role of CHD4 in \ncontrolling HR repair to maintain genome stability and establish the potential \ntherapeutic implications of targeting CHD4 deficiency in tumors.\n\nDOI: 10.1074\/jbc.M111.287037\nPMCID: PMC3307306\nPMID: 22219182 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Amiodarone is a \npotent class III anti-arrhythmic drug that also possesses beta-blocking \nproperties. It is very rich in iodine, with a 100-mg tablet containing an amount \nof iodine that is 250 times the recommended daily iodine requirement. Amiodarone \nproduces characteristic alterations in thyroid function tests in euthyroid \npatients. Understanding these alterations is crucial in avoiding unnecessary \ninvestigations and treatment. Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction occurs \nbecause of both its iodine content and the direct toxic effects of the compound \non thyroid parenchyma. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism is more common in \niodine-deficient regions of the world, whereas amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism \nis usually seen in iodine-sufficient areas. In contrast to amiodarone-induced \nhypothyroidism, amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is a difficult condition to \ndiagnose and treat. In this review, we discuss the alterations in thyroid \nfunction tests seen in euthyroid subjects, the epidemiology and mechanism of \namiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction, treatment options available, and the \nconsequences of amiodarone use in pregnancy and lactation; and finally, we \npropose a follow-up strategy in patients taking amiodarone.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.amjmed.2004.11.028\nPMID: 15989900 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Although amiodarone is considered a class III \nanti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique \nand effective anti-arrhythmic agent. Because of its minimal negative inotropic \nactivity and very low rate of pro-arrhythmia, it is considered safe in treating \narrhythmias in patients with Coronary Artery Disease and Left ventricular \nsystolic dysfunction. Despite these advantages, long term oral therapy with \namiodarone is limited by side effect profile involving various organs like \nthyroid, lung, heart, liver, skin etc. Though the side effects can be decreased \nsignificantly by keeping the maintenance dose at 200 to 300 mg\/day, patients on \namiodarone should be followed closely. Amiodarone interacts with medications \nsuch as Warfarin, Digoxin, Macrolides, Floroquinolones etc., which share \nCytochrome P450 metabolic pathway. Hence reducing their doses prior to starting \namiodarone is recommended. Amiodarone, a category D drug, is contraindicated in \npregnant and breast feeding women.

The CMR demonstrated DE at the left \nventricular (LV) wall in 39 patients. The patients with DE included more cases \nwith dilated phase of HCM, higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes and \nincidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT), lower LV ejection fraction \n(LVEF) and mean LV wall thickness (WT), and a larger ratio of maximum to minimum \nLVWT.

Myocardial scarring is also \nidentified frequently in HCM. However, the impact of myocardial scarring \nassessed by LGE CMR on the presence of AF has not been evaluated yet.\nMETHODS: 87 HCM patients underwent LGE CMR, echocardiography and regular ECG \nrecordings. LV function, volumes, myocardial thickness, left atrial (LA) volume \nand the extent of LGE, were assessed using CMR and correlated to AF. \nAdditionally, the presence of diastolic dysfunction and mitral regurgitation \nwere obtained by echocardiography and also correlated to AF.\nRESULTS: Episodes of AF were documented in 37 patients (42%). Indexed LV volumes \nand mass were comparable between HCM patients with and without AF. However, \nindexed LA volume was significantly higher in HCM patients with AF than in HCM \npatients without AF (68 +\/- 24 ml.m-2 versus 46 +\/- 18 ml.m-2, p = 0.0002, \nrespectively). The mean extent of LGE was higher in HCM patients with AF than \nthose without AF (12.4 +\/- 14.5% versus 6.0 +\/- 8.6%, p = 0.02). When adjusting \nfor age, gender and LV mass, LGE and indexed LA volume significantly correlated \nto AF (r = 0.34, p = 0.02 and r = 0.42, p < 0.001 respectively). By \nechocardiographic examination, LV diastolic dysfunction was evident in 35 (40%) \npatients. Mitral regurgitation greater than II was observed in 12 patients \n(14%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that LA volume and presence of \ndiastolic dysfunction were the only independent determinant of AF in HCM \npatients (p = 0.006, p = 0.01 respectively). Receiver operating characteristic \ncurve analysis indicated good predictive performance of LA volume and LGE (AUC = \n0.74 and 0.64 respectively) with respect to AF.\nCONCLUSION: HCM patients with AF display significantly more LGE than HCM \npatients without AF. However, the extent of LGE is inferior to the LA size for \npredicting AF prevalence. LA dilation is the strongest determinant of AF in HCM \npatients, and is related to the extent of LGE in the LV, irrespective of LV \nmass.\n\nDOI: 10.1186\/1532-429X-11-34\nPMCID: PMC2749835\nPMID: 19740409 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

The \nFlaviviridae family consists of 3 genera which include the Flavivirus genus \n(type species, yellow fever virus) as the largest genus, the Hepacivirus (type \nspecies, hepatitis C virus) and the Pestivirus (type species, bovine virus \ndiarrhea). The flaviviruses (Flavivirus genus) are small RNA viruses transmitted \nby mosquitoes and ticks that take over host cell machinery in order to \npropagate. However, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses are not antropod-borne. \nDespite the extensive research and public health concern associated with \nflavivirus diseases, to date, there is no specific treatment available for any \nflavivirus infections, though commercially available vaccines for yellow fever, \nJapanese encephalitis and tick-born encephalitis exist. Due to the global threat \nof viral pandemics, there is an urgent need for new drugs.

One of NITD's missions is to develop \nantivirals for dengue virus (DENV), the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral \npathogen. Neither vaccine nor antiviral is currently available for DENV. Here we \nreview the progress in dengue drug discovery made at NITD as well as the major \ndiscoveries made by academia and other companies. Four strategies have been \npursued to identify inhibitors of DENV through targeting both viral and host \nproteins: (i) HTS (high-throughput screening) using virus replication assays; \n(ii) HTS using viral enzyme assays; (iii) structure-based in silico docking and \nrational design; (iv) repurposing hepatitis C virus inhibitors for DENV. Along \nthe developmental process from hit finding to clinical candidate, many \ninhibitors did not advance beyond the stage of hit-to-lead optimization, due to \ntheir poor selectivity, physiochemical or pharmacokinetic properties. Only a few \ncompounds showed efficacy in the AG129 DENV mouse model. Two nucleoside analogs, \nNITD-008 and Balapiravir, entered preclinical animal safety study and clinic \ntrial, but both were terminated due to toxicity and lack of potency, \nrespectively. Celgosivir, a host alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, is currently under \nclinical trial; its clinical efficacy remains to be determined. The knowledge \naccumulated during the past decade has provided a better rationale for ongoing \ndengue drug discovery. Though challenging, we are optimistic that this \ncontinuous, concerted effort will lead to an effective dengue therapy.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Several lines of evidence have suggested that OCT3 expressed in the \nbrain plays an important role in the regulation of neurotransmission. Relative \nto wild-type (WT) animals, Oct3 knockout (KO) mice have displayed altered \nbehavioral and neurochemical responses to psychostimulants such as amphetamine \n(AMPH) and methamphetamine. In the present study, both in vitro and in vivo \napproaches were utilized to explore potential mechanisms underlying the \ndisparate neuropharmacological effects observed following AMPH exposure in Oct3 \nKO mice. In vitro uptake studies conducted in OCT3 transfected cells indicated \nthat dextroamphetamine (d-AMPH) is not a substrate of OCT3. However, OCT3 was \ndetermined to be a high-capacity and low-affinity transporter for the \nneurotransmitters dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT). \nInhibition studies demonstrated that d-AMPH exerts relatively weak inhibitory \neffects on the OCT3-mediated uptake of DA, NE, 5-HT, and the model OCT3 \nsubstrate 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide. The IC(50) \nvalues were determined to be 41.5 +\/- 7.5 and 24.1 +\/- 7.0 microM for inhibiting \nDA and 5-HT uptake, respectively, while 50% inhibition of NE and \n4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium iodide uptake was not achieved by \neven the highest concentration of d-AMPH applied (100 microM). Furthermore, the \ndisposition of d-AMPH in various tissues including the brain, liver, heart, \nkidney, muscle, intestine, spleen, testis, uterus, and plasma were determined in \nboth male and female Oct3 KO and WT mice. No significant difference was observed \nbetween either genotypes or sex in all tested organs and tissues. Our findings \nsuggest that OCT3 is not a prominent factor influencing the disposition of \nd-AMPH. Additionally, based upon the inhibitory potency observed in vitro, \nd-AMPH is unlikely to inhibit the uptake of monoamines mediated by OCT3 in the \nbrain. Differentiated neuropharmacological effects of AMPHs noted between Oct3 \nKO and WT mice appear to be due to the absence of Oct3 mediated uptake of \nneurotransmitters in the KO mice.\n\nDOI: 10.1111\/j.1471-4159.2010.06738.x\nPMCID: PMC3775896\nPMID: 20402963 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Although creatine \nand phosphocreatine play important roles in energy homeostasis in the brain, \naccumulation of GCs may induce epileptic discharges and convulsions. This review \nfocuses on how physiologically important and\/or neurotoxic GCs are distributed \nin the brain under physiological and pathological conditions. Transporters for \nGCs at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \nbarrier (BCSFB) have emerged as substantial contributors to GCs distribution in \nthe brain. Creatine transporter (CRT\/solute carrier (SLC) 6A8) expressed at the \nBBB regulates creatine concentration in the brain, and represents a major \npathway for supply of creatine from the circulating blood to the brain. CRT may \nbe a key factor facilitating blood-to-brain guanidinoacetate transport in \npatients deficient in S-adenosylmethionine:guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase, \nthe creatine biosynthetic enzyme, resulting in cerebral accumulation of \nguanidinoacetate. CRT, taurine transporter (TauT\/SLC6A6) and organic cation \ntransporter (OCT3\/SLC22A3) expressed at the BCSFB are involved in \nguanidinoacetic acid or creatinine efflux transport from CSF. Interestingly, BBB \nefflux transport of GCs, including guanidinoacetate and creatinine, is \nnegligible, though the BBB has a variety of efflux transport systems for \nsynthetic precursors of GCs, such as amino acids and neurotransmitters. Instead, \nthe BCSFB functions as a major cerebral clearance system for GCs. In conclusion, \ntransport of GCs at the BBB and BCSFB appears to be the key determinant of the \ncerebral levels of GCs, and changes in the transport characteristics may cause \nthe abnormal distribution of GCs in the brain seen in patients with certain \nneurological disorders.\n\nDOI: 10.1186\/2045-8118-8-13\nPMCID: PMC3058069\nPMID: 21352605"]]}

Using the yeast \ntwo-hybrid system, we found that transforming growth factor-beta inducible early \ngene 1 (TIEG1), a member of the Kr\u00fcppel-like family (KLF) that has been \nimplicated as a putative tumor suppressor, interacts and forms a specific \ncomplex with HPV-16 E7. TIEG1 has been shown to mimic the effects of TGF-beta in \nvarious carcinoma cells and plays a critical role in the apoptotic cascade. Our \nresults indicate that E7 binds to the C-terminus of TIEG1 and induces its \ndegradation via the ubiquitin pathway. E7 not only increased the ubiquitination \nof TIEG1 but also influenced the ability of TIEG1 to affect apoptosis. Our \nresults suggest that suppression of TIEG1-mediated signaling by E7 may \ncontribute to HPV-associated carcinogenesis.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is currently known \nregarding the contribution mitochondrial dynamics play in cytochrome c release \nfollowing oxidative stress in neurodegenerative disease. Here we induced \noxidative stress in the HT22 cell line with glutamate and investigated key \nmediators of mitochondrial dynamics to determine the role this process may play \nin oxidative stress induced neuronal death. We report that glutamate treatment \nin HT22 cells induces increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), release of the \nmitochondrial fusion protein Opa1 into the cytosol, with concomitant release of \ncytochrome c. Furthermore, following the glutamate treatment alterations in cell \nsignaling coincide with mitochondrial fragmentation which culminates in \nsignificant cell death in HT22 cells. Finally, we report that treatment with the \nantioxidant tocopherol attenuates glutamate induced-ROS increase, release of \nmitochondrial Opa1 and cytochrome c, and prevents cell death.\n\nPublished by Elsevier Inc.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/j.mcn.2014.12.007\nPMCID: PMC4429534\nPMID: 25579226 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

In \nthe course of our recent work, we identified that CTMP is consistently \nassociated with leucine zipper\/EF-hand-containing transmembrane-1 (LETM1).

OPA1 cleavage was \nincreased in LETM1-overexpressing cells, and this phenotype was reversed by \noverexpression of OPA1 variant-7, a cleavage resistant form of OPA1.

Recently, another phosphatase gene, \nMINPP1, has been localized to 10q23.3. MINPP1 has the ability to remove \n3-phosphate from inositol phosphate substrates, a function that overlaps that of \nPTEN. Because of this overlapping function with PTEN and the physical location \nof MINPP1 to a region with frequent LOH in follicular thyroid tumors, we \nconsidered it to be an excellent candidate gene that could contribute to the \npathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors. We analyzed DNA from tumor and \ncorresponding normal tissue from 23 patients with FA and 15 patients with FTC \nfor LOH and mutations at the MINPP1 locus. LOH was identified in four malignant \nand three benign tumors. One of these FTCs with LOH was found to harbor a \nsomatic c.122C > T or S41L mutation. We also found two germline sequence \nvariants, c.809A > G (Q270R) and IVS3 + 34T > A. The c.809A > G variant was \nfound in only one patient with FA but not in patients with FTC or normal \ncontrols. More interestingly, IVS3 + 34T > A was found in about 15% of FA cases \nand normal controls but not in patients with FTC. These results suggest a role \nfor MINPP1 in the pathogenesis of at least a subset of malignant follicular \nthyroid tumors, and MINPP1 might act as a low penetrance predisposition allele \nfor FTC.\n\nDOI: 10.1210\/jcem.86.4.7419\nPMID: 11297621 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

PTEN somatic \nmutations occur in sporadic tumors of the endometrium, brain, prostate, or \nmelanomas, while germline mutations predispose to development of the multiple \nhamartoma syndromes (i.e., Cowden's disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome). \nActivation of the two alleles of PTEN is required for its tumor-suppression \nrole. Because the frequency of PTEN suppression in thyroid tumors exceeds that \nof PTEN mutations or deletions, it is very likely that epigenetic mechanisms, \nsuch as promoter hypermethylation, may account for its inactivation in a subset \nof tumors. The main aim of this study was to assess the frequency of promoter \nhypermethylation of PTEN in thyroid tumors. We studied frozen tissue samples \nfrom 46 papillary carcinomas, 7 follicular carcinomas, 6 follicular adenomas as \nwell as 39 normal thyroid tissue samples. Methylation-specific polymerase-chain \nreaction (PCR) with three different sets of primers was used. Two of the primer \nsets were designed to avoid any interference with PTEN pseudogene promoter. PTEN \npromoter hypermethylation was detected in 21 of 46 (45.7%) papillary carcinomas, \n6 of 7 follicular carcinomas, and 5 of 6 follicular adenomas. It was negative in \nall normal tissues. Negative immunohistochemical staining for PTEN was \nsignificantly associated with the presence of promoter hypermethylation (p < \n0.001). These results show a high frequency of PTEN promoter hypermethylation, \nespecially in follicular tumors, suggesting its possible role in thyroid \ntumorigenesis.\n\nDOI: 10.1089\/thy.2006.16.17\nPMID: 16487009 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

We \ntested the effects of ceftriaxone on mortality, neurological outcome, and \ninfarct size in experimental stroke in rats and looked for underlying \nmechanisms.\nMETHODS: Male normotensive Wistar rats received ceftriaxone (200 mg\/kg \nintraperitoneal) as a single injection 90 min after middle cerebral artery \nocclusion (90 min with reperfusion). Forty-eight hours after middle cerebral \nartery occlusion, infarct size (MRI) and neurological deficits were estimated. \nGLT1 expression was determined by real time RT-PCR, immunoblotting and promoter \nreporter assay, astrocyte GLT1 activity by measuring glutamate uptake. Bacterial \nload in various organs was measured by real time RT-PCR, neurotrophins and IL-6 \nby immunoblotting.\nRESULTS: Ceftriaxone dramatically reduced early (24-h) mortality from 34.5% \n(vehicle treatment, n = 29) to 0% (P < 0.01, n = 19). In a subgroup, followed up \nfor 4 weeks, mortality persisted at 0%. Ceftriaxone strongly tended to reduce \ninfarct size, it significantly improved neuronal survival within the penumbra, \nreduced neurological deficits (P < 0.001) and led to an upregulation of \nneurotrophins (P < 0.01) in the peri-infarct zone. Ceftriaxone did not increase \nGLT1 expression, but increased GLT1 activity (P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: Ceftriaxone causes a significant reduction in acute stroke mortality \nin a poststroke treatment regimen in animal studies. Improved neurological \nperformance and survival may be due to neuroprotection by activation of GLT1 and \na stimulation of neurotrophins resulting in an increased number of surviving \nneurons in the penumbra.\n\nDOI: 10.1097\/HJH.0b013e328313e403\nPMID: 19008722 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Recently, miRNA activity has been shown to be \naffected by the presence of miRNA sponge transcripts, the so-called competing \nendogenous RNA in humans and target mimicry in plants. We previously identified \na highly expressed circular RNA (circRNA) in human and mouse brain. Here we show \nthat this circRNA acts as a miR-7 sponge; we term this circular transcript \nciRS-7 (circular RNA sponge for miR-7). ciRS-7 contains more than 70 selectively \nconserved miRNA target sites, and it is highly and widely associated with \nArgonaute (AGO) proteins in a miR-7-dependent manner. Although the circRNA is \ncompletely resistant to miRNA-mediated target destabilization, it strongly \nsuppresses miR-7 activity, resulting in increased levels of miR-7 targets. In \nthe mouse brain, we observe overlapping co-expression of ciRS-7 and miR-7, \nparticularly in neocortical and hippocampal neurons, suggesting a high degree of \nendogenous interaction. We further show that the testis-specific circRNA, \nsex-determining region Y (Sry), serves as a miR-138 sponge, suggesting that \nmiRNA sponge effects achieved by circRNA formation are a general phenomenon. \nThis study serves as the first, to our knowledge, functional analysis of a \nnaturally expressed circRNA.\n\nDOI: 10.1038\/nature11993\nPMID: 23446346 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Recent studies have discovered thousands of endogenous circRNAs \nin mammalian cells. CircRNAs are largely generated from exonic or intronic \nsequences, and reverse complementary sequences or RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) \nare necessary for circRNA biogenesis. The majority of circRNAs are conserved \nacross species, are stable and resistant to RNase R, and often exhibit \ntissue\/developmental-stage-specific expression. Recent research has revealed \nthat circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of splicing \nand transcription, and modifiers of parental gene expression. Emerging evidence \nindicates that circRNAs might play important roles in atherosclerotic vascular \ndisease risk, neurological disorders, prion diseases and cancer; exhibit \naberrant expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic ductal \nadenocarcinoma (PDAC); and serve as diagnostic or predictive biomarkers of some \ndiseases. Similar to miRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), circRNAs are \nbecoming a new research hotspot in the field of RNA and could be widely involved \nin the processes of life.

PET brain \nimaging of monoamine oxidase A (MAO A)-an enzyme metabolizing \nneurotransmitters-revealed that MAO A levels vary widely between healthy men and \nthis variability was not explained by the common MAOA genotype (VNTR genotype), \nsuggesting that environmental factors, through epigenetic modifications, may \nmediate it. Here, we analyzed MAOA methylation in white blood cells (by \nbisulphite conversion of genomic DNA and subsequent sequencing of cloned DNA \nproducts) and measured brain MAO A levels (using PET and [(11)C]clorgyline, a \nradiotracer with specificity for MAO A) in 34 healthy non-smoking male \nvolunteers. We found significant interindividual differences in methylation \nstatus and methylation patterns of the core MAOA promoter. The VNTR genotype did \nnot influence the methylation status of the gene or brain MAO A activity. In \ncontrast, we found a robust association of the regional and CpG site-specific \nmethylation of the core MAOA promoter with brain MAO A levels. These results \nsuggest that the methylation status of the MAOA promoter (detected in white \nblood cells) can reliably predict the brain endophenotype. Therefore, the status \nof MAOA methylation observed in healthy males merits consideration as a variable \ncontributing to interindividual differences in behavior.\n\nDOI: 10.4161\/epi.21976\nPMCID: PMC3469457\nPMID: 22948232 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

The degree to which changes in loci-specific DNA \nmethylation are under the influence of heritable and environmental factors is \nlargely unknown. In this study, we quantitatively measured DNA methylation \nacross the promoter regions of the dopamine receptor 4 gene (DRD4), the \nserotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4\/SERT) and the X-linked monoamine oxidase A \ngene (MAOA) using DNA sampled at both ages 5 and 10 years in 46 MZ twin-pairs \nand 45 DZ twin-pairs (total n=182). Our data suggest that DNA methylation \ndifferences are apparent already in early childhood, even between genetically \nidentical individuals, and that individual differences in methylation are not \nstable over time. Our longitudinal-developmental study suggests that \nenvironmental influences are important factors accounting for interindividual \nDNA methylation differences, and that these influences differ across the genome. \nThe observation of dynamic changes in DNA methylation over time highlights the \nimportance of longitudinal research designs for epigenetic research.\n\nDOI: 10.4161\/epi.5.6.12226\nPMCID: PMC3322496\nPMID: 20505345 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with idiopathic \ndilated cardiomyopathy; however, no systematic search for PLN mutations in heart \nfailure has been conducted.\nMETHODS: We screened a cohort of 1,014 Brazilian patients with heart failure for \nmutations in the PLN gene. Molecular modeling studies of the mutations found \nwere developed. Different disease etiologies were present in our sample: \nidiopathic, ischemic, Chagas, valvular, hypertensive, and others.\nRESULTS: We identified 4 unrelated patients with PLN mutations (prevalence of \n0.4%), 3 of them in the same amino acid residue (R9). Two patients presented a \nG-T missense mutation at the G26 nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-Leu \nsubstitution at codon 9 (R9L). One patient presented a G-A missense mutation at \nthe same nucleotide, which encodes an Arg-His substitution at codon 9 (R9H). The \nfourth affected patient presented a T-G nonsense mutation at the nucleotide 116, \nsubstituting a termination codon for Leu-39 (L39stop). Molecular modeling \nstudies suggested that R9L and R9H mutations might affect the region involved in \nprotein kinase A docking and probably affect the mechanism modulating the \nrelease of phosphorylated PLN from the substrate binding site of protein kinase \nA.\nCONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the PLN gene are a rare cause of heart failure, \npresent almost exclusively in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy etiology. The \nArg9 and Leu39 residues are the leading location of mutations described at this \nlocus to date. Despite the few mutated residues described to date, the clinical \nspectrum of presentation appears to vary considerably.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 Mosby, Inc.

Phospholamban \nmodulates contractility by inhibiting SERCA, and this process is dynamically \nregulated by \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation and phosphorylation of phospholamban. \nHerein we reveal mechanistic insight into how four hereditary mutants of \nphospholamban, Arg(9) to Cys, Arg(9) to Leu, Arg(9) to His, and Arg(14) \ndeletion, alter regulation of SERCA. Deletion of Arg(14) disrupts the protein \nkinase A recognition motif, which abrogates phospholamban phosphorylation and \nresults in constitutive SERCA inhibition. Mutation of Arg(9) causes more complex \nchanges in function, where hydrophobic substitutions such as cysteine and \nleucine eliminate both SERCA inhibition and phospholamban phosphorylation, \nwhereas an aromatic substitution such as histidine selectively disrupts \nphosphorylation. We demonstrate that the role of Arg(9) in phospholamban \nfunction is multifaceted: it is important for inhibition of SERCA, it increases \nthe efficiency of phosphorylation, and it is critical for protein kinase A \nrecognition in the context of the phospholamban pentamer. Given the synergistic \nconsequences on contractility, it is not surprising that the mutants cause \nlethal, hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\nDOI: 10.1074\/jbc.M112.382713\nPMCID: PMC3411000\nPMID: 22707725 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

This review explores the rationale for supplementation \nwith both antioxidants and vitamin D and discusses the evidence to support and \ndeny the benefits of these dietary supplements. The issue of whether athletes \nshould use antioxidant supplements remains highly controversial. Nonetheless, at \npresent there is limited scientific evidence to recommend antioxidant \nsupplements to athletes or other physically active individuals. Therefore, \nathletes should consult with their health care professional and\/or nutritionist \nwhen considering antioxidant supplementation. The issue of whether athletes \nshould supplement with vitamin D is also controversial. While arguments for and \nagainst vitamin D supplementation exist, additional research is required to \ndetermine whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial to athletes. \nNevertheless, based upon the growing evidence that many athletic populations are \nvitamin D deficient or insufficient, it is recommended that athletes monitor \ntheir serum vitamin D concentration and consult with their health care \nprofessional and\/or nutritionist to determine if they would derive health \nbenefits from vitamin D supplementation.\n\nDOI: 10.1080\/02640414.2011.602098\nPMID: 21830999 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

We previously implicated mutations in the \ngene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) as the cause of CMT2D and dSMA-V. \nGARS is a member of the family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases responsible for \ncharging tRNA with cognate amino acids; GARS ligates glycine to tRNA(Gly). Here, \nwe present functional analyses of disease-associated GARS mutations and show \nthat there are not any significant mutation-associated changes in GARS \nexpression levels; that the majority of identified GARS mutations modeled in \nyeast severely impair viability; and that, in most cases, mutant GARS protein \nmislocalizes in neuronal cells.

The clinical course is typically benign and the disease is \nnot life threatening; however, in some cases, severe phenotypes include serious \nrespiratory distress.\nCASE REPORT: Here we describe a 45-year-old woman with a long course of \nmotor-dominant neuropathy. Distal weakness appeared in childhood and became \nworse with age. After a diagnosis of CMT type 2, the symptoms progressed, and in \nher fourth decade, facial and respiratory muscle weakness appeared, ultimately \nrequiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation. There was no family history of \nCMT. Comprehensive analysis of known CMT-related genes revealed a novel \nheterozygous c.815T>A, p.L218Q mutation in glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS), a \ncausative gene for both CMT type 2D (CMT2D) and distal spinal muscular atrophy \ntype V (dSMA-V). This mutation was considered pathogenic based on molecular \nevidence; notably, it was unique in that all other reported GARS mutations \nassociated with severe phenotypes are located in an anticodon-binding domain, \nwhile in this case in an apparently non-functional region of the GARS gene. Not \na simple loss-of-function mechanism, but rather gain-of-function mechanisms have \nalso been reported in GARS mutations. This case provided useful information for \nunderstanding the mechanism of CMT2D\/dSMA-V.\n\nDOI: 10.5692\/clinicalneurol.54.911\nPMID: 25420567 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes \nan element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time \nas well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH \nimage analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a \nthreshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence \nsignal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from \ncell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and \noften insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual \nsegmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we \ndeveloped a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze \nFISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a \nclassification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that \ncontextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and \nboundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently \nand objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH \nFinder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH \nprobes.\nAVAILABILITY: FISH Finder is a standalone MATLAB application and platform \nindependent software.

In this paper we developed a sparse \nrepresentation-based classification (SRC) algorithm based on L1-norm \nminimization for classifying chromosomes from multicolor fluorescence in situ \nhybridization (M-FISH) images. The algorithm has been tested on a comprehensive \nM-FISH database that we established, demonstrating improved performance in \nclassification. When compared with other pixel-wise M-FISH image classifiers \nsuch as fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms and adaptive fuzzy c-means \n(AFCM) clustering algorithms that we proposed earlier the current method gave \nthe lowest classification error. In order to evaluate the performance of \ndifferent SRC for M-FISH imaging analysis, three different sparse representation \nmethods, namely, Homotopy method, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and Least \nAngle Regression (LARS), were tested and compared.

Recently, Np95 (also \nknown as UHRF1 or ICBP90) has been found to interact with Dnmt1 and to bind \nhemimethylated DNA, indicating together with genetic studies a central role in \nthe maintenance of DNA methylation. Using in vitro binding assays we observed a \nweak preference of Np95 and its SRA (SET- and Ring-associated) domain for \nhemimethylated CpG sites. However, the binding kinetics of Np95 in living cells \nwas not affected by the complete loss of genomic methylation. Investigating \nfurther links with heterochromatin, we could show that Np95 preferentially binds \nhistone H3 N-terminal tails with trimethylated (H3K9me3) but not acetylated \nlysine 9 via a tandem Tudor domain. This domain contains three highly conserved \naromatic amino acids that form an aromatic cage similar to the one binding \nH3K9me3 in the chromodomain of HP1ss. Mutations targeting the aromatic cage of \nthe Np95 tandem Tudor domain (Y188A and Y191A) abolished specific H3 histone \ntail binding. These multiple interactions of the multi-domain protein Np95 with \nhemimethylated DNA and repressive histone marks as well as with DNA and histone \nmethyltransferases integrate the two major epigenetic silencing pathways.\n\nDOI: 10.1093\/nar\/gkp1152\nPMCID: PMC2847221\nPMID: 20026581 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

It is still \ncontroversial whether microRNA-21 (miR-21) participates in the process of \ncardiac fibrosis. Our previous study confirmed that transforming growth factor \nbeta receptor III (TGF\u03b2RIII) is a negative regulator of TGF-\u03b2 pathway. Here, we \naimed to decipher the relationship between miR-21 and TGF\u03b2RIII in the pathogenic \nprocess of myocardial fibrosis. We found that TGF-\u03b21 and miR-21 were \nup-regulated, whereas TGF\u03b2RIII was down-regulated in the border zone of mouse \nhearts in response to myocardial infarction. After transfection of miR-21 into \ncardiac fibroblasts, TGF\u03b2RIII expression was markedly reduced and collagen \ncontent was increased. And, luciferase results confirmed that TGF\u03b2RIII was a \ntarget of miR-21. It suggests that up-regulation of miR-21 could increase the \ncollagen content and at least in part through inhibiting TGF\u03b2RIII. Conversely, \nwe also confirmed that overexpression of TGF\u03b2RIII could inhibit the expression \nof miR-21 and reduce collagen production in fibroblasts. Further studies showed \nthat overexpression of TGF\u03b2RIII could also deactivate TGF-\u03b21 pathway by \ndecreasing the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and phosphorylated-Smad3 (p-Smad3). TGF-\u03b21 \nhas been proven as a positive regulator of miR-21. Taken together, we found a \nnovel reciprocal loop between miR-21 and TGF\u03b2RIII in cardiac fibrosis caused by \nmyocardial infarction in mice, and targeting this pathway could be a new \nstrategy for the prevention and treatment of myocardial remodeling.\n\nCrown Copyright \u00a9 2012.

Dysregulation of miRNAs has \nbeen described in various disease states including cancer and cardiac disease. A \nparticular miRNA that was consistently reported to be upregulated in both cancer \nand various forms of cardiovascular diseases is miR-21. MiR-21 exerts oncogenic \nactivity and therefore is considered as an oncomir. In the cardiovascular system \nmiR-21 is enriched in fibroblasts and contributes to the development of fibrosis \nand heart failure. MiR-21 therefore emerges as an interesting candidate for the \ndevelopment of therapeutic strategies against many forms of cancer as well as \nheart diseases. Indeed, treatment with anti-miR-21 oligonucleotides reduced \nbreast cancer growth. Inhibition of miR-21 by synthetic miRNA antagonists \n(antagomirs) improved heart function in a cardiac disease model. The same \nbeneficial effects were observed in miR-21 knockout mice subjected to \npressure-overload of the left ventricle underlining the key role of miR-21 as a \ntherapeutic target.

The BRCA1 protein is an important regulator of DNA \ndouble-strand break repair, and BRCA1-deficient cells are highly sensitive to \nionizing radiation. Furthermore, BRCA1 function may contribute to enforcement of \nthe G(2) cell cycle checkpoint. E3-ubiquitin ligase activity is the only known \nenzymatic activity of BRCA1, which is mediated by the N-terminal RING finger \ndomain. The C-terminal BRCT repeat domain, which mediates protein-protein \ninteractions, is the only other identified structural domain. By investigating \ncancer-linked mutations within each domain, we demonstrate that truncation of \nthe BRCT domain greatly impairs the stability and nuclear localization of BRCA1 \nprotein. A missense mutation within the RING domain does not affect these \nbiochemical properties. However, both mutant forms of BRCA1 fail to colocalize \nin nuclear foci with the known BRCA1-interacting proteins BARD1 and BACH1, which \nare important for DNA repair. This failure occurs despite the continued ability \nof the RING mutant protein to interact with BACH1 and the ability of the BRCT \nmutant to interact with BARD1. Furthermore, neither mutant form of BRCA1 is \nrecruited into DNA damage-associated foci marked by gamma-H2AX. Therefore, our \ndata suggest that both the RING and BRCT domains of BRCA1 are required for an \nearly step in the function of BRCA1 during DNA repair: recruitment to the sites \nof DNA damage.\n\nDOI: 10.1667\/RR1290.1\nPMCID: PMC4550207\nPMID: 20681793 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

A problem of particular interest is the \nidentification of regions of the genome where different cell types from the same \norganism exhibit different patterns of histone enrichment. This problem turns \nout to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because \nof the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data. In this paper we propose a \ntwo-stage statistical method, called ChIPnorm, to normalize ChIP-seq data, and \nto find differential regions in the genome, given two libraries of histone \nmodifications of different cell types. We show that the ChIPnorm method removes \nmost of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization \nmethods. We correlate the histone marks with gene expression data and confirm \nthat histone modifications H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 act as respectively a repressor \nand an activator of genes. Compared to what was previously reported in the \nliterature, we find that a substantially higher fraction of bivalent marks in ES \ncells for H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 move into a K27-only state.

Bader Center for \nResearch on Arthritis and Autoimmune Disease, University of Texas Southwestern \nMedical Center, Dallas, TX 75390, USA.\n\nThe SLAM\/CD2 gene family encodes receptors that play important roles in \nregulating multiple cellular interactions in the adaptive and innate immune \nsystems. Three members of this gene family, Ly108, Ly9, and CD84, exhibit \npolymorphisms that strongly influence susceptibility to systemic autoimmunity, \nnotably in mice, but also in some human populations. Polymorphisms of Ly108 in \nmice strongly impact central tolerance in both B and T cell development, \npredominantly by modulating apoptosis, anergy, and cell-cycle progression. In \naddition, Ly108 and CD84, together with their downstream signaling adaptor \nSLAM-associated protein (SAP), have emerged as key players in B-T interactions \nduring the formation of germinal centers. Interestingly, several independent \nlines of research have now associated variations in B-T interactions during \ngerminal center formation with systemic autoimmunity, suggesting that \nsusceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) may involve in part the \nimpairment of this peripheral tolerance checkpoint. These new insights into the \nmultiplicity of roles played by the SLAM\/CD2 family and its potential importance \nin human autoimmunity positions the SLAM\/CD2 family as an excellent target for \nimmunotherapy.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it can be incorporated in human \ncells and can trigger immune response. In the present study, we detected \nanti-Neu5Gc antibodies in samples of the general population and of patients \nsuffering from hypothyroidism\/Hashimoto's disease, which is known to have \nautoimmune origin.\nMETHODS: Antibodies were measured using enzyme-immunosorbent techniques.\nRESULTS: Serum anti-Neu5Gc IgG antibodies were higher in patients with \nhypothyroidism (mean: 14.8 \u00b1 15.9 \u03bcg\/mL, median: 10.0 \u03bcg\/mL, P = 0.0003, \nMann-Whitney) and even higher in the group with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (mean: \n31.1 \u00b1 16.3 \u03bcg\/mL, median: 27.2 \u03bcg\/mL, P = 0.0000, Mann-Whitney) compared to the \ngeneral population (mean: 5.3 \u00b1 4.7 \u03bcg\/mL, median : 4 \u03bcg\/mL). All anti-TPO \npositive samples had anti-Neu5Gc antibody concentration higher than the mean \nvalue of the general population while anti-TPO concentration was increased as \nanti-Neu5Gc concentration increased. Low concentrations of IgA and IgM \nantibodies were measured in both general population and patient groups.\nCONCLUSION: The increased values of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in patients with \nhypothyroidism\/Hashimoto's disease and the correlation of anti-TPO incidence \nwith increased anti-Neu5Gc concentration raise the possibility of an association \nbetween anti-Neu5Gc antibody development and autoimmune hypothyroidism.\n\nDOI: 10.1155\/2014\/963230\nPMCID: PMC4070528\nPMID: 25003133 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Losing this sugar changed how humans interact with \nsome of our deadliest pathogens: malaria, influenza, and streptococcus among \nothers. We show that the New World monkeys, comprising the third of all primate \nspecies, have human-like sialic acid biology. They have lost Neu5Gc because of \nan independent CMAH inactivation ~30 million\u00a0years ago (mya) (compared to ~3\u00a0mya \nin hominids). This parallel loss of Neu5Gc opens sialic acid biology to \ncomparative phylogenetic analysis and reveals an unexpected conservation \npriority. New World monkeys risk infection by human pathogens that can recognize \ncells in the absence of Neu5Gc. This striking molecular convergence provides a \nmechanism that could explain the long-standing observation that New World \nmonkeys are susceptible to some human diseases that cannot be transmitted to \nother primates.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s00251-014-0795-0\nPMCID: PMC4198446\nPMID: 25124893 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

The genes atxA, located on pXO1, and acpA, located \non pXO2, encode positive trans-acting proteins that are involved in \nbicarbonate-mediated regulation of toxin and capsule production, respectively. A \nderivative strain cured of pXO1 produced less capsular substance than the parent \nstrain harbouring both pXO1 and pXO2, and electroporation of the strain cured of \npXO1 with a plasmid containing the cloned atxA gene resulted in an increased \nlevel of capsule production. An acpA-null mutant was complemented by not only \nacpA but also the atxA gene. The cap region, which is essential for \nencapsulation, contains three genes capB, capC, and capA, arranged in that \norder. The atxA gene stimulated capsule synthesis from the cloned cap region. \nTranscriptional analysis of cap by RNA slot-blot hybridization and \nprimer-extension analysis revealed that atxA activated expression of cap in \ntrans at the transcriptional level. These results indicate that cross-talk \noccurs, in which the pXO1-located gene, atxA, activates transcription of the cap \nregion genes located on pXO2. We identified two major apparent transcriptional \nstart sites, designated P1 and P2, located at positions 731 bp and 625 bp, \nrespectively, upstream of the translation-initiation codon of capB. \nTranscription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA and acpA, and \nactivation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate. Deletion analysis of the \nupstream region of the cap promoter revealed that activation by both atxA and \nacpA required a DNA segment of 70 bp extending upstream of the P1 site. These \nresults suggest that cross-talk by atxA to the genes encoding capsule synthesis \nis caused by the interaction of the atxA gene product with a regulatory sequence \nupstream of cap.\n\nDOI: 10.1046\/j.1365-2958.1997.3041667.x\nPMID: 9106214 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

In atxA+ strains, expression of the toxin genes (pag, lef, and cya) is \nenhanced by two physiologically significant signals: elevated CO2\/bicarbonate \nand temperature. To determine whether increased toxin gene expression in \nresponse to these signals is associated with increased atxA expression, we \nmonitored steady-state levels of atxA mRNA and AtxA protein in cells cultured in \ndifferent conditions. We purified histidine-tagged AtxA [AtxA(His)] from \nEscherichia coli and used anti-AtxA(His) serum to detect AtxA in protein \npreparations from B. anthracis cells. AtxA was identified as a protein with an \napparent size of 56 kDa in cytoplasmic fractions of B. anthracis cells. Our data \nindicate that atxA expression is not influenced by CO2\/bicarbonate levels. \nHowever, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in cells grown in elevated \nCO2\/bicarbonate at 37 degrees C is five- to sixfold higher than that observed in \ncells grown in the same conditions at 28 degrees C. A corresponding difference \nin AtxA protein was also seen at the different growth temperatures. When atxA \nwas cloned on a multicopy plasmid in B. anthracis, AtxA levels corresponding to \nthe atxA gene copy number were observed. However, this strain produced \nsignificantly less pag mRNA and protective antigen protein than the parental \nstrain harboring atxA in single copy on pXO1. These results indicate that \nincreased AtxA expression does not lead to a corresponding increase in pag \nexpression. Our data strongly suggest that an additional factor(s) is involved \nin regulation of pag and that the relative amounts of such a factor(s) and AtxA \nare important for optimal toxin gene expression.\n\nDOI: 10.1128\/iai.65.7.2576-2582.1997\nPMCID: PMC175364\nPMID: 9199422 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

The register is compiled from searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, \nPsycINFO and Web of Science using MeSH terms and free text to identify \ncontrolled trials of interventions for smoking cessation and prevention. We \ncontacted authors of trial reports for additional information where necessary. \nThe latest update of the specialised register was in December 2011. We also \nsearched online clinical trials registers.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials which compared the \ntreatment drug with placebo. We also included comparisons with bupropion and \nnicotine patches where available. We excluded trials which did not report a \nminimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data on the type of participants, the \ndose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization \nprocedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow-up.The main \noutcome measured was abstinence from smoking at longest follow-up. We used the \nmost rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated \nrates where they were reported. Where appropriate we pooled risk ratios (RRs), \nusing the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.\nMAIN RESULTS: Two recent cytisine trials (937 people) found that more \nparticipants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared with placebo at longest \nfollow-up, with a pooled RR of 3.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.01 to 7.87). \nOne trial of dianicline (602 people) failed to find evidence that it was \neffective (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.75). Fifteen trials compared varenicline \nwith placebo for smoking cessation; three of these also included a bupropion \ntreatment arm. We also found one open-label trial comparing varenicline plus \ncounselling with counselling alone. We found one relapse prevention trial, \ncomparing varenicline with placebo, and two open-label trials comparing \nvarenicline with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). We also include one trial \nin which all the participants were given varenicline, but received behavioural \nsupport either online or by phone calls, or by both methods. This trial is not \nincluded in the analyses, but contributes to the data on safety and \ntolerability. The included studies covered 12,223 participants, 8100 of whom \nused varenicline.The pooled RR for continuous or sustained abstinence at six \nmonths or longer for varenicline at standard dosage versus placebo was 2.27 (95% \nCI 2.02 to 2.55; 14 trials, 6166 people, excluding one trial evaluating long \nterm safety). Varenicline at lower or variable doses was also shown to be \neffective, with an RR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.78; 4 trials, 1272 people). The \npooled RR for varenicline versus bupropion at one year was 1.52 (95% CI 1.22 to \n1.88; 3 trials, 1622 people). The RR for varenicline versus NRT for point \nprevalence abstinence at 24 weeks was 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.35; 2 trials, 778 \npeople). The two trials which tested the use of varenicline beyond the 12-week \nstandard regimen found the drug to be well-tolerated during long-term use. The \nmain adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was mostly at mild to \nmoderate levels and usually subsided over time. A meta-analysis of reported \nserious adverse events occurring during or after active treatment and not \nnecessarily considered attributable to treatment suggests there may be a \none-third increase in the chance of severe adverse effects among people using \nvarenicline (RR 1.36; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.79; 17 trials, 7725 people), but this \nfinding needs to be tested further. Post-marketing safety data have raised \nquestions about a possible association between varenicline and depressed mood, \nagitation, and suicidal behaviour or ideation. The labelling of varenicline was \namended in 2008, and the manufacturers produced a Medication Guide. Thus far, \nsurveillance reports and secondary analyses of trial data are inconclusive, but \nthe possibility of a link between varenicline and serious psychiatric or \ncardiovascular events cannot be ruled out.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Cytisine increases the chances of quitting, although \nabsolute quit rates were modest in two recent trials. Varenicline at standard \ndose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between \ntwo- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. \nLower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the \nincidence of adverse events. More participants quit successfully with \nvarenicline than with bupropion. Two open-label trials of varenicline versus NRT \nsuggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule \nout equivalence. Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to \nplay in relapse prevention. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, \nbut mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible \nlinks with serious adverse events, including serious psychiatric or \ncardiovascular events, cannot be ruled out.Future trials of cytisine may test \nextended regimens and more intensive behavioural support. There is a need for \nfurther trials of the efficacy of varenicline treatment extended beyond 12 \nweeks.\n\nDOI: 10.1002\/14651858.CD006103.pub6\nPMID: 22513936 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Varenicline was developed as a nicotine receptor \npartial agonist from cytisine, a drug widely used in central and eastern Europe \nfor smoking cessation. The first trial reports of varenicline were released in \n2006, and further trials have now been published or are currently underway.\nOBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and \ntolerability of nicotine receptor partial agonists, including varenicline and \ncytisine, for smoking cessation.\nSEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised \nregister for trials, using the terms ('varenicline' or 'cytisine' or 'Tabex' or \n'nicotine receptor partial agonist') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or \nas keywords. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL using MeSH \nterms and free text, and we contacted authors of trial reports for additional \ninformation where necessary. The latest search was in September 2010.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials which compared the \ntreatment drug with placebo. We also included comparisons with bupropion and \nnicotine patches where available. We excluded trials which did not report a \nminimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data on the type of participants, the \ndose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization \nprocedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up.The main \noutcome measured was abstinence from smoking after at least six months from the \nbeginning of treatment. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and \npreferred biochemically validated rates where they were reported. Where \nappropriate we performed meta-analysis to produce a risk ratio, using the \nMantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.\nMAIN RESULTS: We found 11 trials of varenicline compared with placebo for \nsmoking cessation; three of these included a bupropion experimental arm. We also \nfound one relapse prevention trial, comparing varenicline with placebo, and two \nopen-label trials comparing varenicline with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). \nWe also include one trial in which all the participants were given varenicline, \nbut received behavioural support either online or by phone calls, or by both \nmethods. This trial is not included in the analyses, but contributes to the data \non safety and tolerability. The included studies covered >10,300 participants, \n6892 of whom used varenicline. We identified one trial of cytisine (Tabex) for \ninclusion.The pooled risk ratio (RR) (10 trials, 4443 people, excluding one \ntrial evaluating long term safety) for continuous abstinence at six months or \nlonger for varenicline at standard dosage versus placebo was 2.31 (95% \nconfidence interval [CI] 2.01 to 2.66). Varenicline at lower or variable doses \nwas also shown to be effective, with an RR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.56 to 2.78; 4 \ntrials, 1272 people). The pooled RR for varenicline versus bupropion at one year \nwas 1.52 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.88; 3 trials, 1622 people). The RR for varenicline \nversus NRT for point prevalence abstinence at 24 weeks was 1.13 (95% CI 0.94 to \n1.35; 2 trials, 778 people). The two trials which tested the use of varenicline \nbeyond the 12-week standard regimen found the drug to be well-tolerated during \nlong-term use. The main adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was \nmostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. Post-marketing \nsafety data raised questions about a possible association between varenicline \nand depressed mood, agitation, and suicidal behaviour or ideation. The labelling \nof varenicline was amended in 2008, and the manufacturers produced a Medication \nGuide. Thus far, surveillance reports and secondary analyses of trial data lend \nlittle support to a causal relationship.The one cytisine trial included in this \nreview found that more participants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared \nwith placebo at two-year follow up, with an RR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.08).\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of \nsuccessful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with \npharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. Lower dose regimens also conferred \nbenefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. More \nparticipants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. Two \nopen-label trials of varenicline versus NRT suggested a modest benefit of \nvarenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. Limited \nevidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse \nprevention. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild \nto moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible links with serious \nadverse events, including depressed mood, agitation and suicidal thoughts, have \nbeen reported but are so far not substantiated.There is a need for further \nindependent community-based trials of varenicline, to test its efficacy and \nsafety in smokers with varying co-morbidities and risk patterns. There is a need \nfor further trials of the efficacy of treatment extended beyond 12 weeks. \nCytisine may also increase the chances of quitting, but the evidence at present \nis inconclusive.\n\nDOI: 10.1002\/14651858.CD006103.pub4\nPMID: 21154363 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

The role of other exonic \nNOTCH3 variation not involving cysteine residues and mutations in exons 25-33 in \nischemic stroke remains unresolved.\nMETHODS: All 33 exons of NOTCH3 were sequenced in 269 Caucasian probands from \nthe Siblings With Ischemic Stroke Study (SWISS), a 70-center North American \naffected sibling pair study and 95 healthy Caucasian control subjects. Variants \nidentified by sequencing in the SWISS probands were then tested for association \nwith ischemic stroke using US Caucasian controls collected at the Mayo Clinic \n(n=654), and further assessed in a Caucasian (n=802) and African American \n(n=298) patient-control series collected through the Ischemic Stroke Genetics \nStudy (ISGS).\nRESULTS: Sequencing of the 269 SWISS probands identified one (0.4%) with small \nvessel type stroke carrying a known CADASIL mutation (p.R558C; Exon 11). Of the \n19 common NOTCH3 variants identified, the only variant significantly associated \nwith ischemic stroke after multiple testing adjustment was p.R1560P (rs78501403; \nExon 25) in the combined SWISS and ISGS Caucasian series (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.50, \nP=0.0022) where presence of the minor allele was protective against ischemic \nstroke. Although only significant prior to adjustment for multiple testing, \np.T101T (rs3815188; Exon 3) was associated with an increased risk of \nsmall-vessel stroke (OR: 1.56, P=0.008) and p.P380P (rs61749020; Exon 7) was \nassociated with decreased risk of large-vessel stroke (OR: 0.35, P=0.047) in \nCaucasians. No significant associations were observed in the small African \nAmerican series.\nCONCLUSION: Cysteine-affecting NOTCH3 mutations are rare in patients with \ntypical ischemic stroke, however our observation that common NOTCH3 variants may \nbe associated with risk of ischemic stroke warrants further study.\n\nDOI: 10.1371\/journal.pone.0075035\nPMCID: PMC3781028\nPMID: 24086431 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: Owen A.

Electronic address: pierre.fenaux@sls.aphp.fr.\n\nDuring many years, very limited data had been available on specific gene \nmutations in MDS in particular due to the fact that balanced chromosomal \ntranslocations (which have allowed to discover many \"leukemia\" genes) are very \nrare in MDS, while chromosomal deletions are generally very large, making it \ndifficult to identify genes of interest. Recently, the advent of next generation \nsequencing (NGS) techniques has helped identify somatic gene mutations in 75-80% \nof MDS, that cluster mainly in four functional groups, i.e. cytokine signaling \n(RAS genes), DNA methylation, (TET2, IDH1\/2, DNMT3a genes) histone modifications \n(ASXL1 and EZH2 genes), and spliceosome (SF3B1 and SRSF2 genes) along with \nmutations of RUNX1 and TP 53 genes. Most of those mutations, except SF3B1 and \nTET2 mutations, are associated with an overall poorer prognosis, while some gene \nmutations (mainly TET2 mutation), may be associated to better response to \nhypomethylating agents. The frequent mutations of epigenetic modulators in MDS \nappear to largely contribute to the importance of epigenetic deregulation (in \nparticular gene hypermethylation and histone deacetylation) in MDS progression, \nand may account at least partially for the efficacy of hypomethylating agents in \nthe treatment of MDS.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Interaction between these two signaling \npathways could modify RET expression and, therefore, HSCR phenotype. Here, we \nreport the case of a 1-year-old Taiwanese boy who presented with abdominal \ndistension since birth and bilious vomiting after feeding. HSCR (short-segment \ntype) was diagnosed based on X-ray, lower gastrointestinal series and biopsy \nfindings. Mutation analysis revealed a heterozygous T>C missense mutation in \nexon 1 of the EDNRB gene, that substitutes the highly conserved cysteine-90 \nresidue in the extracellular domain of the G protein-coupled receptor with an \narginine residue (C90R). No RET gene mutation was detected in this patient.\n\nDOI: 10.1016\/S0929-6646(09)60128-5\nPMID: 16618617 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Carfilzomib and its orally \nbioavailable structural analog oprozomib are second-generation, \nhighly-selective, proteasome inhibitors. However, the mechanisms of acquired \nresistance to carfilzomib and oprozomib are incompletely understood, and \neffective strategies for overcoming this resistance are needed. Here, we \ndeveloped models of acquired resistance to carfilzomib in two head and neck \nsquamous cell carcinoma cell lines, UMSCC-1 and Cal33, through gradual exposure \nto increasing drug concentrations. The resistant lines R-UMSCC-1 and R-Cal33 \ndemonstrated 205- and 64-fold resistance, respectively, relative to the parental \nlines. Similarly, a high level of cross-resistance to oprozomib, as well as \npaclitaxel, was observed, whereas only moderate resistance to bortezomib (8- to \n29-fold), and low level resistance to cisplatin (1.5- to 5-fold) was seen. \nSynergistic induction of apoptosis signaling and cell death, and inhibition of \ncolony formation followed co-treatment of acquired resistance models with \ncarfilzomib and the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat. Synergism \nwas also seen with other combinations, including oprozomib plus vorinostat, or \ncarfilzomib plus the HDACi entinostat. Synergism was accompanied by upregulation \nof proapoptotic Bik, and suppression of Bik attenuated the synergy. The acquired \nresistance models also exhibited elevated levels of MDR-1\/P-gp. Inhibition of \nMDR-1\/P-gp with reversin 121 partially overcame carfilzomib resistance in \nR-UMSCC-1 and R-Cal33 cells.

Caveolin and cavin proteins, as well as EHD2 and pacsin \n2, are all present in caveolae. How these proteins assemble to form a protein \ninteraction network for caveolar morphogenesis is not known. Using in vivo \ncrosslinking, velocity gradient centrifugation, immuno-isolation, and tandem \nmass spectrometry, we determine that cavins and caveolins assemble into a \nhomogenous 80S complex, which we term the caveolar coat complex. There are no \nfurther abundant components within this complex, and the complex excludes EHD2 \nand pacsin 2. Cavin 1 forms trimers and interacts with caveolin 1 with a molar \nratio of about 1\u22364. Cavins 2 and 3 compete for binding sites within the overall \ncoat complex, and form distinct subcomplexes with cavin 1. The core interactions \nbetween caveolin 1 and cavin 1 are independent of cavin 2, cavin 3, and EHD2 \nexpression, and the cavins themselves can still interact in the absence of \ncaveolin 1. Using immuno-electron microscopy as well as a recently developed \nprotein tag for electron microscopy (MiniSOG), we demonstrate that caveolar coat \ncomplexes form a distinct coat all around the caveolar bulb. In contrast, and \nconsistent with our biochemical data, EHD2 defines a different domain at the \ncaveolar neck. 3D electron tomograms of the caveolar coat, labeled using \ncavin-MiniSOG, show that the caveolar coat is composed of repeating units of a \nunitary caveolar coat complex.\n\nDOI: 10.1371\/journal.pbio.1001640\nPMCID: PMC3754886\nPMID: 24013648 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors have declared that no competing \ninterests exist."],["1.

While a \ngreat deal of attention has focused on derivation and molecular regulation of \nstem cells, relatively little research has focused on how the subcellular \nstructure and composition of the cell membrane influences stem cell activities \nsuch as proliferation, differentiation and homing. Caveolae are specialized \nmembrane lipid rafts coated with caveolin scaffolding proteins, which can \nregulate cholesterol transport and the activity of cell signaling receptors and \ntheir downstream effectors. Caveolin-1 is involved in the regulation of many \ncellular processes, including growth, control of mitochondrial antioxidant \nlevels, migration and senescence. These activities are of relevance to stem cell \nbiology, and in this review evidence for caveolin-1 involvement in stem cell \nbiology is summarized. Altered stem and progenitor cell populations in \ncaveolin-1 null mice suggest that caveolin-1 can regulate stem cell \nproliferation, and in vitro studies with isolated stem cells suggest that \ncaveolin-1 regulates stem cell differentiation. The available evidence leads us \nto hypothesize that caveolin-1 expression may stabilize the differentiated and \nundifferentiated stem cell phenotype, and transient downregulation of caveolin-1 \nexpression may be required for transition between the two. Such regulation would \nprobably be critical in regenerative applications of adult stem cells and during \ntissue regeneration. We also review here the temporal changes in caveolin-1 \nexpression reported during tissue repair. Delayed muscle regeneration in \ntransgenic mice overexpressing caveolin-1 as well as compromised cardiac, brain \nand liver tissue repair and delayed wound healing in caveolin-1 null mice \nsuggest that caveolin-1 plays an important role in tissue repair, but that this \nrole may be negative or positive depending on the tissue type and the nature of \nthe repair process. Finally, we also discuss how caveolin-1 quiescence-inducing \nactivities and effects on mitochondrial antioxidant levels may influence stem \ncell aging.\n\nDOI: 10.1186\/scrt276\nPMCID: PMC3854699\nPMID: 23899671 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

We identified a \nchromatin compartment in both diploid and endocycling cells of the urochordate, \nOikopleura dioica, enriched in heterochromatic histone modifications and DNA \nmethylation.

Finally, we show that it is \npossible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become \ndepleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through \nselection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic \ndivisions.\n\nDOI: 10.1371\/journal.pgen.1004646\nPMCID: PMC4207606\nPMID: 25340765 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: The authors have declared that no competing \ninterests exist."]]}

Here we show \nthat TRIM67, which has a TRIM motif, an FN3 domain and a SPRY domain, is highly \nexpressed in the cerebellum and that TRIM67 interacts with PRG-1 and 80K-H, \nwhich is involved in the Ras-mediated signaling pathway. Ectopic expression of \nTRIM67 results in degradation of endogenous 80K-H and attenuation of cell \nproliferation and enhances neuritogenesis in the neuroblastoma cell line \nN1E-115. Furthermore, morphological and biological changes caused by knockdown \nof 80K-H are similar to those observed by overexpression of TRIM67.

Our \nbiochemical data demonstrated that TRIM50 is specifically expressed in gastric \nparietal cells and is predominantly localized in the tubulovesicular and \ncanalicular membranes. In cultured cells ectopically expressing GFP-TRIM50, \nconfocal microscopic imaging revealed dynamic movement of TRIM50-associated \nvesicles in a phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent manner. A protein overlay \nassay detected preferential binding of the PRY-SPRY domain from the TRIM50 \nC-terminal region to phosphatidylinositol species, suggesting that TRIM50 is \ninvolved in vesicular dynamics by sensing the phosphorylated state of \nphosphoinositol lipids. Trim50 knock-out mice retained normal histology in the \ngastric mucosa but exhibited impaired secretion of gastric acid. In response to \nhistamine, Trim50 knock-out parietal cells generated deranged canaliculi, \nswollen microvilli lacking actin filaments, and excess multilamellar membrane \ncomplexes. Therefore, TRIM50 seems to play an essential role in tubulovesicular \ndynamics, promoting the formation of sophisticated canaliculi and microvilli \nduring acid secretion in parietal cells.\n\nDOI: 10.1074\/jbc.M112.370551\nPMCID: PMC3460453\nPMID: 22872646 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Here \nwe characterize paraspeckles, a subnuclear domain containing p54nrb and other \nRNA-binding proteins including PSP1, a protein with sequence similarity to \np54nrb that acts as a marker for paraspeckles. We show that PSP1 interacts in \nvivo with a subset of the total cellular pool of p54nrb. We map the domain \nwithin PSP1 that is mediating this interaction and show it is required for the \ncorrect localization of PSP1 to paraspeckles. This interaction is necessary but \nnot sufficient for paraspeckle targeting by PSP1, which also requires an RRM \ncapable of RNA binding. Blocking the reinitiation of RNA Pol II transcription at \nthe end of mitosis with DRB prevents paraspeckle formation, which recommences \nafter removal of DRB, indicating that paraspeckle formation is dependent on RNA \nPolymerase II transcription.

Electronic address: \nstephen.robertson@otago.ac.nz.\n\nRobinow syndrome (RS) is a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous \ncondition that can be caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the \nnon-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In contrast, germline mutations that act to \nincrease canonical Wnt signaling lead to distinctive osteosclerotic phenotypes. \nHere, we identified de novo frameshift mutations in DVL1, a mediator of both \ncanonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling, as the cause of RS-OS, an RS subtype \ninvolving osteosclerosis, in three unrelated individuals. The mutations all \ndelete the DVL1 C terminus and replace it, in each instance, with a novel, \nhighly basic sequence. We showed the presence of mutant transcript in \nfibroblasts from one individual with RS-OS and demonstrated unimpaired protein \nstability with transfected GFP-tagged constructs bearing a frameshift mutation. \nIn\u00a0vitro TOPFlash assays, in apparent contradiction to the osteosclerotic \nphenotype, revealed that the mutant allele was less active than the wild-type \nallele in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. However, when the mutant and \nwild-type alleles were co-expressed, canonical Wnt activity was 2-fold higher \nthan that in the wild-type construct alone. This work establishes that DVL1 \nmutations cause a specific RS subtype, RS-OS, and that the osteosclerosis \nassociated with this subtype might be the result of an interaction between the \nwild-type and mutant alleles and thus lead to elevated canonical Wnt signaling.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 The American Society of Human Genetics.

Causative variants in the non-canonical signaling \ngene WNT5A underlie a subset of autosomal-dominant Robinow syndrome (DRS) cases, \nbut most individuals with DRS remain without a molecular diagnosis. We performed \nwhole-exome sequencing in four unrelated DRS-affected individuals without coding \nmutations in WNT5A and found heterozygous DVL1 exon 14 mutations in three of \nthem. Targeted Sanger sequencing in additional subjects with DRS uncovered DVL1 \nexon 14 mutations in five individuals, including a pair of monozygotic twins. In \ntotal, six distinct frameshift mutations were found in eight subjects, and all \nwere heterozygous truncating variants within the penultimate exon of DVL1. In \nfive families in which samples from unaffected parents were available, the \nvariants were demonstrated to represent de novo mutations. All variant alleles \nare predicted to result in a premature termination codon within the last exon, \nescape nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), and most likely generate a C-terminally \ntruncated protein with a distinct -1 reading-frame terminus. Study of the \ntranscripts extracted from affected subjects' leukocytes confirmed expression of \nboth wild-type and variant alleles, supporting the hypothesis that mutant mRNA \nescapes NMD. Genomic variants identified in our study suggest that truncation of \nthe C-terminal domain of DVL1, a protein hypothesized to have a downstream role \nin the Wnt-5a non-canonical pathway, is a common cause of DRS.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 The American Society of Human Genetics.

Our results show that the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory \nparticle is a new anticancer drug target.\n\nDOI: 10.1038\/nm.2536\nPMID: 22057347 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

We have previously shown that AML1\/MDS1\/EVI1 (AME), a \nfusion gene generated by a t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation found in patients with \nchronic myelogenous leukemia during blast phase, myelodysplastic syndrome, or \nacute myelogenous leukemia (AML), impairs hematopoiesis and eventually induces \nan AML in mice. Both fusion partners of AME, AML1 and MDS1\/EVI1, encode \ntranscription factors and are also targets of a variety of genetic abnormalities \nin human hematologic malignancies. In addition, aberrant expression of ectopic \nviral integration site 1 (EVI1) has also been found in solid tumors, such as \novarian and colon cancers. In this study, we examined whether ATO could target \nAME and related oncoproteins. We found that ATO used at therapeutic levels \ndegrades AME. The ATO treatment induces differentiation and apoptosis in AME \nleukemic cells in vitro as well as reduces tumor load and increases the survival \nof mice transplanted with these cells. We further found that ATO targets AME via \nboth myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS1) and EVI1 moieties and degrades EVI1 via \nthe ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and MDS1 in a proteasome-independent manner. \nOur results suggest that ATO could be used as a part of targeted therapy for \nAME-, AML1\/MDS1-, MDS1\/EVI1-, and EVI1-positive human cancers.\n\nDOI: 10.1158\/0008-5472.CAN-06-1774\nPMID: 17145882 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

Both \nexhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents. We find that \nabsence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and \nleads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle \nassembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, \nand core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and \nothers suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication \nfork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. We find that Ctf18p, an RFC1-like \nprotein, directly interacts with Rfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. However, Ctf18p \nis not a component of biochemically purified proliferating cell nuclear antigen \nloading RF-C, suggesting the presence of a discrete complex containing Ctf18p, \nRfc2p, Rfc3p, Rfc4p, and Rfc5p. Recent identification and characterization of \nthe budding yeast polymerase kappa, encoded by TRF4, strongly supports a \nhypothesis that the DNA replication machinery is required for proper sister \nchromatid cohesion. Analogous to the polymerase switching role of the bacterial \nand human RF-C complexes, we propose that budding yeast RF-C(CTF18) may be \ninvolved in a polymerase switch event that facilities sister chromatid cohesion. \nThe requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for \nreplication accessory proteins in this process.\n\nDOI: 10.1128\/MCB.21.9.3144-3158.2001\nPMCID: PMC86942\nPMID: 11287619 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

We \nanalyzed sister-chromatid cohesion in double mutants of mrc1Delta, tof1Delta, \nand csm3Delta and identified additive cohesion defects that indicated the \nexistence of at least two pathways that contribute to sister-chromatid cohesion. \nTo understand the relationship of other nonessential cohesion genes with respect \nto these two pathways, pairwise combinations of deletion and \ntemperature-sensitive alleles were tested for cohesion defects.

Recent studies demonstrate that piperlongumine selectively kills \nvarious types of transformed cells with minimal toxicity to non-transformed \ncells by inducing a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS generates \nvarious types of DNA lesions, including base modifications and single strand \nbreaks. In order to examine the contribution of ROS-induced DNA damage to the \ncytotoxicity by piperlongumine, various DNA repair-deficient chicken DT40 \ncell-lines with a single DNA repair gene deletion were tested for cellular \nsensitivity to piperlongumine. The results showed that cell lines defective in \nhomologous recombination (HR) display hyper-sensitivity to piperlongumine, while \nother cell lines with a deficiency in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), base \nexcision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), Fanconi anemia (FA) \npathway, or translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases, show no sensitivity to \npiperlongumine. The results strongly implicate that double strand breaks (DSBs) \ngenerated by piperlongumine are major cytotoxic DNA lesions. Furthermore, a \ndeletion of 53BP1 or Ku70 in the BRCA1-deficient cell line restored cellular \nresistance to piperlongumine. This strongly supports the idea that \npiperlongumine induces DSB- mediated cell death.

To identify specific \nbiomarkers of BCSCs, we have performed comparative proteomics of BCSC-enriched \nand mature cancer cell populations from the human breast cancer cell line (BCL), \nBrCA-MZ-01.\nMETHODS: ALDEFLUOR assay was used to sort BCSC-enriched (ALDH+) and mature \ncancer (ALDH-) cell populations. Total proteins were extracted from both \nfractions and subjected to 2-Dimensional Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis (2-D \nDIGE). Differentially-expressed spots were excised and proteins were \ngel-extracted, digested and identified using MALDI-TOF MS.\nRESULTS: 2-D DIGE identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) as \noverexpressed in ALDH+ cells from BrCA-MZ-01. This observation was confirmed by \nwestern blot and extended to four additional human BCLs. ALDH+ cells from \nBRCA1-mutated HCC1937, which had the highest level of PARP1 overexpression, \ndisplayed resistance to olaparib, a specific PARP1 inhibitor.\nCONCLUSION: An unbiased proteomic approach identified PARP1 as upregulated in \nALDH+, BCSC-enriched cells from various human BCLs, which may contribute to \nclinical resistance to PARP inhibitors.\n\nDOI: 10.1371\/journal.pone.0104302\nPMCID: PMC4140711\nPMID: 25144364 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nConflict of interest statement: Competing Interests: The authors have read the \njournal\u2019s policy and have the following conflicts: This work was supported by a \ngrant from Sanofi-Aventis.

To evaluate the effect of LT4 treatment, LT4 was withdrawn for 35 days \nand subsequently reinitiated. Data were collected from medical records, by \nreanalysis of serum collected over the last 6 years, and by a detailed clinical \nevaluation.\nRESULTS: Treatment with LT4 resulted in a suppression of serum TSH and \nnormalization of serum free T\u2084 and rT\u2083, whereas T\u2083 levels remained elevated in \nboth patients. In addition, there was a normalization of the dyslipidemia as \nwell as a response in serum IGF-I, SHBG, and creatine kinase in the index \npatient. All these parameters returned to pretreatment values when LT4 was \nbriefly stopped. LT4 also resulted in an improvement of certain clinical \nfeatures, such as constipation and nerve conductance. However, cognitive and \nfine motor skill defects remained.\nCONCLUSION: This study reports the consequences of LT4 treatment over a \nprolonged period of time in 2 of the first patients with a heterozygous mutation \nin TR\u03b11.

Still, the mechanism underlying tetramerization--the necessary \nstep for the formation of functional receptors that can be inserted into the \nplasma membrane--is unknown. All eukaryotic compared to prokaryotic iGluR \nsubunits have an additional transmembrane segment, the M4 segment, which \npositions the physiologically critical C-terminal domain on the cytoplasmic side \nof the membrane. AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits lacking M4 do not express on the \nplasma membrane. Here, we show that these constructs are retained in the \nendoplasmic reticulum, the major cellular compartment mediating protein \noligomerization. Using approaches to assay the native oligomeric state of AMPAR \nsubunits, we find that subunits lacking M4 or containing single amino acid \nsubstitutions along an \"interacting\" face of the M4 helix that block surface \nexpression no longer tetramerize in either homomeric or heteromeric assemblies. \nIn contrast, subunit dimerization appears to be largely intact. These \nexperiments define the M4 segment as a unique functional unit in AMPARs that is \nrequired for the critical dimer-to-tetramer transition.\n\nDOI: 10.1523\/JNEUROSCI.2626-12.2013\nPMCID: PMC3714855\nPMID: 23739980 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Our knowledge about the ultrastructure and subunit assembly \nmechanisms of intact AMPA-Rs was very limited. However, the new studies using \nsingle particle EM and X-ray crystallography are revealing important insights. \nFor example, the tetrameric crystal structure of the GluA2cryst construct \nprovided the atomic view of the intact receptor. In addition, the single \nparticle EM structures of the subunit assembly intermediates revealed the \nconformational requirement for the dimer-to-tetramer transition during the \nmaturation of AMPA-Rs. These new data in the field provide new models and \ninterpretations. In the brain, the native AMPA-R complexes contain auxiliary \nsubunits that influence subunit assembly, gating, and trafficking of the \nAMPA-Rs. Understanding the mechanisms of the auxiliary subunits will become \nincreasingly important to precisely describe the function of AMPA-Rs in the \nbrain. The AMPA-R proteomics studies continuously reveal a previously unexpected \ndegree of molecular heterogeneity of the complex. Because the AMPA-Rs are \nimportant drug targets for treating various neurological and psychiatric \ndiseases, it is likely that these new native complexes will require detailed \nmechanistic analysis in the future. The current ultrastructural data on the \nreceptors and the receptor-expressing stable cell lines that were developed \nduring the course of these studies are useful resources for high throughput drug \nscreening and further drug designing. Moreover, we are getting closer to \nunderstanding the precise mechanisms of AMPA-R-mediated synaptic plasticity.\n\nDOI: 10.1007\/s12035-010-8149-x\nPMCID: PMC2992128\nPMID: 21080238 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

SGLT2 inhibitors \nrepresent the latest oral agents for diabetes treatment. Their unique mechanism \nof action, which practically spares the insulin secretion or insulin \nutilization, differentiates the SGLT2 inhibitors from any existing antidiabetic \nagent. Thus, it is hypothesized that SGLT2 inhibitors can be effectively (and \nprobably safely) combined with any existing antidiabetic agent (including \ninsulin), either as monotherapy, or in dual or triple combinations. All these \nhypotheses are currently tested in many clinical trials. Currently \ndapagliflozin, one of the three most advanced SGLT2 inhibitors in the \ndevelopment (along with canagliflozin and empagliflozin), is already in the \nmarket in few European countries and canagliflozin has been approved from the \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) in US. The evidence so far shows that SGLT2 \ninhibitors are equally effective to established antidiabetic agents such as \nmetformin or sulfonylureas in their ability to lower HbA1c. On the other hand, \nSGLT2 inhibitors increase the possibility of genitourinary infections in type 2 \ndiabetic individuals.

The \ngenome overall NER is called global genomic repair (GGR). Elc1, the yeast \nhomolog of the mammalian elongation factor elongin C, has been shown to be a \ncomponent of a ubiquitin ligase complex that contains Rad7 and Rad16, two \nfactors that are specifically required for GGR. Elc1 has also been suggested to \nbe present in another ubiquitin ligase complex that lacks Rad7 and Rad16 and is \ninvolved in UV-induced ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of RNA \npolymerase II. Here we show that elc1 deletion increases UV sensitivity of \nTCR-deficient cells but does not affect the UV sensitivity of otherwise wild \ntype and GGR-deficient cells. Cells deleted for elc1 show normal NER in the \ntranscribed strand of an active gene but have no detectable NER in the \nnon-transcribed strand. Elc1 does not affect UV-induced mutagenesis when TCR is \noperative, but plays an important role in preventing the mutagenesis if TCR is \ndefective. Furthermore, the levels of Rad7 and Rad16 proteins are not \nsignificantly decreased in elc1 cells, and overexpression of Rad7 and Rad16 \nindividually or simultaneously in elc1 cells does not restore repair in the \nnon-transcribed strand of an active gene. Our results suggest that Elc1 has no \nfunction in TCR but plays an important role in GGR.

Yeast appears to differ from bacteria \nand human cells in the capacity for transcription-coupled repair in a mismatch \nrepair mutant background.\n\nDOI: 10.1093\/genetics\/143.3.1127\nPMCID: PMC1207384\nPMID: 8807287 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

The incidence of familial \noccurrence accounts for 9% of cases. The characteristic lesions of moyamoya \ndisease are occasionally seen in neurofibromatosis type 1, of which the \ncausative gene (NF1) has been assigned to chromosome 17q11.2.\nMETHODS: To determine whether a gene related to moyamoya disease is located on \nchromosome 17, we conducted microsatellite linkage analyses on 24 families \ncontaining 56 patients with moyamoya disease. Leukocyte DNA extracted from the \nfamily members was subjected to polymerase chain reaction for a total of 22 \nmicrosatellite markers on chromosome 17. The amplified polymerase chain reaction \nfragments were analyzed with GeneScan on an automated sequencer.\nRESULTS: Two-point linkage analysis gave a maximum log(10) odds (LOD) score of \n3.11 at the recombination fraction of 0.00 for the marker at locus D17S939. The \naffected pedigree member method also showed a significantly low P value (<1. \n0x10(-5)) for the 5 adjacent markers at 17q25. Multipoint linkage analysis also \nindicated that the disease gene is contained within the 9-cM region of D17S785 \nto D17S836, with a maximum LOD score of 4. 58.\nCONCLUSIONS: A gene for familial moyamoya disease is located on chromosome \n17q25.\n\nDOI: 10.1161\/01.str.31.4.930\nPMID: 10754001 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"],["1.

Past medical history revealed \nhearing loss and developmental delay\/intellectual disability. Routine karyotype \ndemonstrated extra chromosomal material on 6p. Single nucleotide polymorphism \nmicroarray revealed a previously unreported complex de novo genetic \nrearrangement involving subtelomeric segments on chromosomes 6p and 12q. The \nduplicated\/deleted regions included several known OMIM-annotated genes. This \nnovel phenotype and genotype provides information about a possible association \nof genomic copy number variation and moyamoya syndrome. Dosage-sensitive genes \nin the deleted and duplicated segments may be involved in aberrant vascular \nproliferation. Our case also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive \nevaluation of both developmental delay and congenital anomalies such as \nmoyamoya.\n\nDOI: 10.1542\/peds.2012-0749\nPMID: 23713105 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}

This study investigates the in vivo splicing phenotypes of \nmutations in the branch site consensus sequence of the U12-dependent intron F \nfrom a human NOL1 (P120) minigene. Intron F contains a fully consensus branch \nsite sequence (UUCCUUAAC). Mutations at each position were analyzed for their \neffects on U12-dependent splicing in vivo. Mutations at most positions resulted \nin a significant reduction of correct U12-dependent splicing. Defects observed \nincluded increased unspliced RNA levels, the activation of cryptic U2-dependent \n5' and 3' splice sites, and the activation of cryptic U12-dependent branch\/3' \nsplice sites. A strong correlation was observed between the predicted \nthermodynamic stability of the branch site: U12 snRNA interaction and correct \nU12-dependent splicing. The lack of a polypyrimidine tract between the branch \nsite and 3' splice site of U12-dependent introns and the observed reliance on \nbase-pairing interactions for correct U12-dependent splicing emphasize the \nimportance of RNA\/RNA interactions during U12-dependent intron recognition and \nproper splice site selection.\n\nDOI: 10.1261\/rna.1189008\nPMCID: PMC2578861\nPMID: 18824513 [Indexed for MEDLINE]"]]}
